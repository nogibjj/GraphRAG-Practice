Investigators’ adherence to guidelines was checked at each investigators’ meeting.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, day 28, and day 180; the percentage of patients from whom care was withheld or withdrawn; the percentage of patients weaned from vasopressors at day 28 and day 90; the time to weaning from vasopressors; the number of days that patients were alive and free of vasopressors (vasopressor-free days) up to day 28 and day 90 (patients who died before day 28 or day 90 were assigned zero free days); the percentage of patients weaned from mechanical ventilation at day 28 and day 90; the time to weaning from mechanical ventilation; ventilator-free days up to day 28 and day 90; the percentage of patients with a total SOFA score below 6 (organ-failure–free) at day 28 and day 90; the time to reaching a SOFA score below 6; organ-failure–free days up to day 28 and day 90; the percentage of patients discharged from the ICU and hospital up to day 28 and day 90; the time to discharge from the ICU and hospital; and ICU-free and hospital-free days up to day 28 and day 90.\nSafety outcomes included superinfection up to day 180, gastrointestinal bleeding up to day 28, episodes of hyperglycemia up to day 7, and neurologic sequelae (cognitive impairment and muscle weakness) at the time of ICU and hospital discharge, day 90, and day 180. All adverse events were recorded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities classification (Tables S13 and S14 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nStatistical Analysis\nWe anticipated a 90-day mortality of 45% among patients with septic shock.19 According to the 2-by-2 factorial design with a two-sided formulation, 320 patients were needed in each group (i.e., a total of 1280 patients) to detect an absolute difference of 10 percentage points in 90-day mortality (α=0.05 and power at 95%) between either drotrecogin alfa (activated) or corticosteroids and placebo. An intention-to-treat analysis was planned to be performed after all the participants had completed the 180-day follow-up and according to the 2-by-2 factorial design.13 Owing to the withdrawal of Xigris from the market in 2011, the trial continued with two parallel groups (see the protocol) and was underpowered to assess the effect of drotrecogin alfa (activated). The sponsor terminated the trial when the expiration dates of the trial agents were reached and 1241 patients (97% of the expected sample size) had been enrolled.\nThe analysis compared all the patients assigned to receive hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone with those assigned to receive corresponding placebos. Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations. Categorical variables are presented as the number of patients in each category and the corresponding percentages. Missing data were not replaced. The effects of trial agents on the frequency of fatal events (mortality at day 28, at day 90, at discharge from the ICU or hospital, and at day 180) and safety outcomes were compared with the use of logistic-regression models and the chi-square test. Continuous variables were compared with the use of analyses of variance and t-tests. Cumulative event curves (censored end points) were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier procedure, and Cox models and the log-rank test were used to compare the effects of trial agents (time to ICU and hospital discharge). The Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard regression models, which extend the Cox model to competing risk data by considering the hazard function associated with the cumulative incidence function, were used to compare the effects of trial agents (time to weaning from vasopressors, to weaning from mechanical ventilation, and to reaching a SOFA score <6). No adjustment for multiple testing was made. All analyses were conducted with SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nResults\nBaseline Patient Characteristics\nThere were 34 participating centers. The first and last patients were recruited on September 2, 2008, and June 23, 2015, respectively. The trial was suspended twice: first, from October 25, 2011, to May 12, 2012, after the withdrawal of Xigris from the market, and second, at the request of the data and safety monitoring board, from July 22, 2014, to October 7, 2014, to check the quality of the trial agents and the distribution of serious adverse events.13 On October 1, 2014, the data and safety monitoring board confirmed the conformity of the trial to the marketing-authorization application for fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone and the quality of their placebos; the board also confirmed that the distribution of serious adverse events between the groups did not justify halting the trial. The trial was completed on December 23, 2015 (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Table 1 shows the primary baseline characteristics of the patients. (See also Tables S1 through S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.) Patient demographic data, severity-of-illness scores, characteristics of infection, and treatments at baseline were similar in the two groups. Most patients were admitted from a medical ward and had severe septic shock, as evidenced by high\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
