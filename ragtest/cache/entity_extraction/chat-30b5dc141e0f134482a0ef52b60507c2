There was also an increase in the odds of pneumothorax requiring drainage as a function of progressive percentiles of \\u916 P but not of VT (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\\\nFIGURE 2\\\n\\\nRelative Risk of Death in the Hospital versus \\uc0\\u916 P in the Combined Cohort after Multivariate Adjustment.\\\nTEST OF MEDIATION\\\nAfter observing that \\uc0\\u916 P was associated with outcomes in each study, we performed a multilevel mediation analysis23 with the use of trial as a random effect, initially pooling the five VT studies and then pooling the four PEEP studies (Fig. S8 through S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). A consistency analysis (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix) testing moderated mediation also suggested that there was consistency across trials.\\\nReductions in \\uc0\\u916 P after randomization were significantly associated with better survival in both cohorts (step 2 of mediation analysis) (Fig. S8 and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix), independently of baseline elastance of the respiratory system, and had similar effect sizes in both cohorts (relative risk for VT trials, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.74; relative risk for PEEP trials, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.72).\\\nFor the VT and PEEP trials, treatment-group assignment was an independent predictor of survival. Except for \\uc0\\u916 P, however, no mediation candidate consistently passed through the stepwise mediation tests (Fig. S10 and S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). VT per se was not a significant mediator in the VT trials (P=0.68 for the average causal mediation effect), and PEEP was not a significant mediator in the PEEP trials (P=0.50). In contrast, \\u916 P mediated 75% of the benefits due to treatment-group assignment in the VT trials (P=0.004 for the average causal mediation effect) and 45% of these benefits in the PEEP trials (P=0.001). This was enough to suppress the significance of the direct effect of the randomized treatment group, classically characterizing complete mediation.\\\nThus, although \\uc0\\u916 P was not an explicit target, survival benefits in the VT trials were proportional to reductions in \\u916 P driven by treatment-group assignment rather than to reductions in VT (tested as a continuous variable). Similarly, the survival benefits observed in the PEEP trials occurred in relation to reductions in \\u916 P rather than in relation to numerical increments in PEEP.\\\nDiscussion\\\nIn trials of mechanical ventilation involving patients with ARDS, in which VT and PEEP were included as independent variables, the dependent quantity \\uc0\\u916 P was the variable that was most strongly associated with survival. Although causality can be inferred only from direct controlled trials, we found, using a statistical approach that adjusted for the effect of underlying lung disease on the mechanical characteristics of the lung, that \\u916 P was a critical mediator of the benefits of various interventions. Our analyses indicated that reductions in VT or increases in PEEP driven by random treatment-group assignment were beneficial only if associated with decreases in \\u916 P. No other ventilation variable had such a mediating effect.\\\nWe identified the striking correlations between VT and survival or between VT and barotrauma only when we scaled VT to individual CRS values (\\uc0\\u916 P=VT/CRS) (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). This scaling has a strong physiological basis. In patients with ARDS, CRS is directly related to functional lung size (the volume of aerated lung available for tidal ventilation).17,18 These observations suggest that the aerated lung in a patient with ARDS is not \\'93stiff\\'94 but is small, with nearly normal specific compliance (compliance per unit of lung volume) in preserved areas.\\\nThe rationale underlying our mediation analysis was that \\uc0\\u916 P was the surrogate for cyclic lung strain that was most accessible and easiest to calculate27; \\u916 P is defined as the amount of cyclic parenchymal deformation imposed on ventilated, preserved lung units. We also postulated that cyclic strain predicts lung injury better than VT. Implicitly, we hypothesized that the functional lung size during disease is better quantified by CRS than by predicted body weight. Under such conditions, especially when CRS varies considerably among patients, cyclic strain, ventilator-induced lung injury, and survival should all be correlated with \\u916 P rather than with VT.\\\nAlthough this mediation analysis cannot establish causality, experimental studies provide a plausible link between \\uc0\\u916 P and ventilator-induced lung injury. Many studies suggest that cell and tissue damage are more closely related to the amplitude of cyclic stretch than to the maximal level of stretch \\'97 that is, lung tissue can undergo sustained stretching without damage.5,7,8,27\\'9630\\\nOur study has a number of limitations. First, our conclusions are valid only for ventilation in which the patient is not making respiratory efforts. It is difficult to interpret \\uc0\\u916 P in actively breathing patients. Second, we studied a relatively narrow range of variables. Thus, extrapolations to patients with plateau pressures greater than 40 cm of water, PEEPs less than 5 cm of water, or respiratory rates greater than 35 breaths per minute are not warranted. Finally, we did not directly estimate the cyclic gradient of pressures across the lung (transpulmonary \\u916 P), which is the probable effector of parenchymal injury. Because a large fraction of \\u916 P is typically applied to inflate the lung in patients with severe ARDS, \\u916 P was probably\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
