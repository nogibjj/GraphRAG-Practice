One patient had a serious adverse reaction to transfusion (Table 2, and Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix). The use of life support at days 5, 14, and 28 was similar in the two intervention groups (Table 2, and Tables S11 and S13 in the Supplementary Appendix), as were the percentages of days alive without vasopressor or inotropic therapy, without mechanical ventilation, and without renal-replacement therapy and the percentage of days alive and out of the hospital (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nIn this international, multicenter, partially blinded, randomized trial involving patients with septic shock who were in the ICU, we observed no significant differences in mortality at 90 days, in the numbers of patients with ischemic events or with severe adverse reactions, in the use of life support, or in the numbers of days alive and out of the hospital between the group of patients who underwent transfusion at a lower hemoglobin threshold and the group of those who underwent transfusion at a higher hemoglobin threshold. Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with chronic cardiovascular disease, with older age, or with greater disease severity. The patients in the lower-threshold group received 50% fewer units of blood than those in the higher-threshold group, and 36% of the patients in the lower-threshold group did not undergo transfusion in the ICU, as compared with 1% of the patients in the higher-threshold group.\nOur results are consistent with those obtained in the TRICC trial, which assessed a lower versus higher hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion in a broad population of adult patients in the ICU.9 In that trial, there were no significant differences in mortality at 30 days in the full trial population (the primary outcome) or among patients 55 years of age or older or those with more severe disease; these two subgroups may best resemble our patients. Our results are also in line with those of a large trial involving high-risk patients after hip surgery, the Transfusion Trigger Trial for Functional Outcomes in Cardiovascular Patients Undergoing Surgical Hip Fracture Repair (FOCUS) trial,27 and the Cochrane meta-analysis of trials of transfusion thresholds, both of which support restrictive transfusion to reduce the use of blood in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease.28 An important exception is patients with acute myocardial infarction, who were excluded both from our trial and from the FOCUS trial.27 Research is needed to assess the safety of lower hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion in these patients.12\nThe effect of transfusion thresholds on rates of myocardial infarction may have differed among the three trials. In the TRICC trial, significantly increased rates of myocardial infarction were observed with a higher transfusion threshold,9 whereas the opposite was observed in the FOCUS trial and in our trial, although the numerical differences were not significant in either of these two trials.27 In our trial, myocardial infarction was not a prespecified outcome measure (the data are provided in the Supplementary Appendix); we did not specify surveillance testing for myocardial ischemia in the protocol and may have missed some events. This may also have resulted in detection bias because the clinicians and investigators were not unaware of the intervention assignments.\nWe observed no harm with an excess transfusion of a median of 3 units of blood, a finding that is contrary to most of the observational data regarding transfusion in critically ill patients.10 Whether this was due to the use of leukoreduced blood cannot be assessed, but results similar to ours were observed in the FOCUS trial, in which the majority of patients also received leukoreduced blood.27 The safety of leukoreduced blood was challenged by the results of a trial involving patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which showed increased mortality with liberal transfusion of this product.11 Ongoing bleeding may have contributed to the increased mortality observed with liberal transfusion in that trial.11 Thus the effects of leukoreduction on outcome are unclear, as they were a decade ago, as indicated in a 2004 meta-analysis of trial data on leukoreduced versus nonleukoreduced blood.29\nThe strengths of our trial include a low risk of bias, because group assignment at randomization was concealed, and the blinding of the assessors of mortality and the statistician to the assigned intervention. It is reasonable to assume that our results are generalizable, because patients were recruited both in university hospitals and in nonuniversity hospitals, and the majority of patients who underwent screening were included. The trial protocol was pragmatic, so routine practice was maintained except for the hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion. In addition, the characteristics of the patients and the outcome rates were similar to those observed in some recent trials involving patients with septic shock in the ICU.3,19,30,31\nOur trial has limitations. First, the investigators, clinicians, and patients were aware of the study-group assignments, and we did not assess all the cointerventions. Because the trial was multicenter and large and used stratified randomization, it is unlikely that imbalance in concomitant interventions affected the results. Second, the confidence interval was relatively wide for the point estimate for mortality, so we cannot exclude a 9% relative increase or a 22% relative decrease in mortality at 90 days in the lower-threshold group versus\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ICU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intensive Care Unit where patients with septic shock were treated and observed for the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRICC TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>A trial that assessed lower versus higher hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion in adult ICU patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOCUS TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>A trial involving high-risk patients after hip surgery to study transfusion triggers for functional outcomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCHRANE META-ANALYSIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A comprehensive analysis of trials on transfusion thresholds, supporting restrictive transfusion in patients with cardiovascular disease)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ICU<|>TRICC TRIAL<|>Patients in the ICU were part of the TRICC trial, which is related to the study's context<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ICU<|>FOCUS TRIAL<|>The ICU setting is relevant to the context of the FOCUS trial, which also involves patient care and treatment strategies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRICC TRIAL<|>COCHRANE META-ANALYSIS<|>The TRICC trial's findings contribute to the body of evidence in the Cochrane meta-analysis on transfusion thresholds<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOCUS TRIAL<|>COCHRANE META-ANALYSIS<|>The FOCUS trial's results are part of the evidence reviewed in the Cochrane meta-analysis<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
