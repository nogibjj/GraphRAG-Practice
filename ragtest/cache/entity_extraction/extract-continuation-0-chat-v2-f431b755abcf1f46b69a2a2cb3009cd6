The median time to insertion was 1.1 hours (interquartile range, 0.7 to 1.6), and the mean ScvO2 was 72.7±10.5%. A central venous catheter was inserted during the first 6 hours in 494 patients (61.9%) in the usual-care group. The median time to insertion was 1.2 hours (interquartile range, 0.4 to 2.6). No patients in the usual-care group received continuous ScvO2 monitoring during the first 6 hours.\nThe volume of intravenous fluids administered during the first 6 hours was greater in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group (1964±1415 ml vs. 1713±1401 ml, P<0.001) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). More patients in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group received a vasopressor infusion (66.6% vs. 57.8%), red-cell transfusion (13.6% vs. 7.0%), or dobutamine (15.4% vs. 2.6%) (P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Between 6 and 72 hours, the proportion of patients receiving vasopressor infusions was higher in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group (58.8% vs. 51.5%, P=0.004), as was the proportion of patients receiving dobutamine (9.5% vs. 5.0%, P<0.001) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nEGDT was stopped prematurely in 18 patients (2.3%). The median time to cessation was 3.5 hours (interquartile range, 1.2 to 5.6). The most common reasons were withdrawal of therapy (5 patients), transfer to the operating room (2 patients), and interhospital transfer (3 patients).\nPhysiological and Laboratory Values\nAt the end of the 6-hour intervention period, the mean arterial pressure was higher in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group (76.5±10.8 mm Hg vs. 75.3±11.4 mm Hg, P=0.04). Other physiological and laboratory values were similar in the two groups (Fig. S3 and Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). The proportions of patients in the EGDT group for whom the individual resuscitation goals were achieved at 6 hours or for whom the relevant therapy was delivered when a goal was not achieved were 99.6% for saturation of peripheral oxygen, 88.9% for central venous pressure, 94.1% for mean arterial pressure, and 95.3% for ScvO2 (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). At 72 hours after randomization, physiological and laboratory values were similar in the two groups (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPrimary Outcome\nBy 90 days after randomization, the primary outcome (death from any cause) had occurred in 147 of 792 patients (18.6%) in the EGDT group and 150 of 796 patients (18.8%) in the usual-care group (P=0.90) (Table 2, and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). The absolute difference in the risk of death for the EGDT group as compared with the usual care group was −0.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], −4.1 to 3.6). The survival time did not differ significantly between the groups (Figure 2A). Between-group mortality was similar in all the predefined subgroups (Figure 2B). There were no significant between-group differences in 90-day mortality with the use of multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards analysis after adjustment for the prespecified baseline covariates (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival and Subgroup Analyses of the Risk of Death at 90 Days.\nTable 2\n\nStudy Outcomes.\nSecondary and Tertiary Outcomes\nThe median length of stay in the emergency department after randomization was shorter in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group (1.4 hours [interquartile range, 0.5 to 2.7] vs. 2.0 hours [interquartile range, 1.0 to 3.8], P<0.001) (Table 2). Overall, more patients in the EGDT group than in the usual-care group received a vasopressor infusion (76.3% vs. 65.8%, P<0.001), but the median duration of the infusion did not differ significantly between the two groups (29.4 hours [interquartile range, 12.9 to 61.0] and 34.2 hours [interquartile range, 14.0 to 67.0], respectively; P=0.24). There were no other significant between-group differences in secondary or tertiary outcomes. Subsidiary analyses of secondary and tertiary variables after adjustment for predefined covariates did not alter any of the reported findings (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nAdverse Events\nThere was no significant between-group difference in the number of patients with one or more adverse events: 56 patients (7.1%) in the EGDT group and 42 patients (5.3%) in the usual-care group (P=0.15). A breakdown of specific adverse events is presented in Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nDiscussion\nIn this randomized trial conducted in a variety of health care settings\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients receiving early goal-directed therapy, which includes interventions like vasopressor infusion, red-cell transfusion, and dobutamine administration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients receiving standard care without the early interventions applied to the EGDT group)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT GROUP<|>USUAL-CARE GROUP<|>The EGDT group received more intensive treatment compared to the usual-care group, including higher volumes of intravenous fluids and more frequent use of vasopressor infusions and dobutamine<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
