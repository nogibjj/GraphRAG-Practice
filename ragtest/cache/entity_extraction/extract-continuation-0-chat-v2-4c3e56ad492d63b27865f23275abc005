We conducted a trial to determine whether these findings were generalizable and whether all aspects of the protocol were necessary.\nMethods\nIn 31 emergency departments in the United States, we randomly assigned patients with septic shock to one of three groups for 6 hours of resuscitation: protocol-based EGDT; protocol-based standard therapy that did not require the placement of a central venous catheter, administration of inotropes, or blood transfusions; or usual care. The primary end point was 60-day in-hospital mortality. We tested sequentially whether protocol-based care (EGDT and standard-therapy groups combined) was superior to usual care and whether protocol-based EGDT was superior to protocol-based standard therapy. Secondary outcomes included longer-term mortality and the need for organ support.\nResults\nWe enrolled 1341 patients, of whom 439 were randomly assigned to protocol-based EGDT, 446 to protocol-based standard therapy, and 456 to usual care. Resuscitation strategies differed significantly with respect to the monitoring of central venous pressure and oxygen and the use of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, inotropes, and blood transfusions. By 60 days, there were 92 deaths in the protocol-based EGDT group (21.0%), 81 in the protocol-based standard-therapy group (18.2%), and 86 in the usual-care group (18.9%) (relative risk with protocol-based therapy vs. usual care, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.31; P=0.83; relative risk with protocol-based EGDT vs. protocol-based standard therapy, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.51; P=0.31). There were no significant differences in 90-day mortality, 1-year mortality, or the need for organ support.\nConclusions\nIn a multicenter trial conducted in the tertiary care setting, protocol-based resuscitation of patients in whom septic shock was diagnosed in the emergency department did not improve outcomes. (Funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences; ProCESS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00510835.)\nThere are more than 750,000 cases of severe sepsis and septic shock in the United States each year.1 Most patients who present with sepsis receive initial care in the emergency department, and the short-term mortality is 20% or more.2,3 In 2001, Rivers et al. reported that among patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in a single urban emergency department, mortality was significantly lower among those who were treated according to a 6-hour protocol of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) than among those who were given standard therapy (30.5% vs. 46.5%).4 On the basis of the premise that usual care lacked aggressive, timely assessment and treatment, the protocol for EGDT called for central venous catheterization to monitor central venous pressure and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), which were used to guide the use of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, packed red-cell transfusions, and dobutamine in order to achieve prespecified physiological targets. In the decade since the publication of that article, there have been many changes in the management of sepsis, raising the question of whether all elements of the protocol are still necessary.5–7\nTo address this question, we designed a multicenter trial comparing alternative resuscitation strategies in a broad cohort of patients with septic shock. Specifically, we tested whether protocol-based resuscitation was superior to usual care and whether a protocol with central hemodynamic monitoring to guide the use of fluids, vasopressors, blood transfusions, and dobutamine was superior to a simpler protocol that did not include these elements.\nMethods\nStudy Oversight\nWe conducted the multicenter, randomized Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) trial at 31 hospitals in the United States. The institutional review board at the University of Pittsburgh and at each other participating site approved the registered study protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The National Institute of General Medical Sciences funded the study and convened an independent data and safety monitoring board (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). The ScvO2 monitoring equipment for the study was loaned to the sites by Edwards Lifesciences, but the company had no other role in the study. Study coordinators at each site entered data into a secure Web-based data-collection instrument. The University of Pittsburgh Clinical Research, Investigation, and Systems Modeling of Acute Illness (CRISMA) Center managed all the data and generated blinded and unblinded reports for the data and safety monitoring board. We reported the statistical analysis plan before the data were unblinded.8 The clinical coordinating team and investigators at the participating sites remained unaware of the study-group outcomes until the data were locked in December 2013. The writing committee vouches for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol.\nSites and Patients\nAll the participating sites were academic hospitals with more than 40,000 emergency department visits yearly. To be eligible, the study sites had to use the measurement of serum lactate levels as the method for screening for cryptogenic shock and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EARLY GOAL-DIRECTED THERAPY (EGDT)<|>EVENT<|>A 6-hour protocol for treating severe sepsis and septic shock involving intravenous fluids, vasopressors, inotropes, and blood transfusions to reach central hemodynamic targets)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTOCOL-BASED STANDARD THERAPY<|>EVENT<|>A resuscitation strategy for septic shock that does not require central venous catheter, inotropes, or blood transfusions)##\n(\"entity\"<|>USUAL CARE<|>EVENT<|>Standard treatment provided for septic shock without the specific protocols used in EGDT or protocol-based standard therapy)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Funded the ProCESS trial, a study comparing different resuscitation strategies for septic shock)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTOCOLIZED CARE FOR EARLY SEPTIC SHOCK (PROCESS) TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>A multicenter, randomized trial comparing resuscitation strategies for septic shock in the emergency department)##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lead institution for the ProCESS trial, overseeing study protocol and data management)##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Company that loaned ScvO2 monitoring equipment for the ProCESS trial)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISMA CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Clinical Research, Investigation, and Systems Modeling of Acute Illness Center at the University of Pittsburgh managing data for the ProCESS trial)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EARLY GOAL-DIRECTED THERAPY (EGDT)<|>PROTOCOL-BASED STANDARD THERAPY<|>Both are resuscitation strategies tested against usual care in the ProCESS trial<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES<|>PROTOCOLIZED CARE FOR EARLY SEPTIC SHOCK (PROCESS) TRIAL<|>The National Institute of General Medical Sciences funded the ProCESS trial<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH<|>PROTOCOLIZED CARE FOR EARLY SEPTIC SHOCK (PROCESS) TRIAL<|>The University of Pittsburgh led the ProCESS trial and managed its protocol and data<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES<|>PROTOCOLIZED CARE FOR EARLY SEPTIC SHOCK (PROCESS) TRIAL<|>Edwards Lifesciences provided ScvO2 monitoring equipment for the ProCESS trial<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRISMA CENTER<|>PROTOCOLIZED CARE FOR EARLY SEPTIC SHOCK (PROCESS) TRIAL<|>The CRISMA Center managed data for the ProCESS trial<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
