Because respiratory-system compliance (CRS) is strongly related to the volume of aerated remaining functional lung during disease (termed functional lung size), we hypothesized that driving pressure (\\uc0\\u916 P=VT/CRS), in which VT is intrinsically normalized to functional lung size (instead of predicted lung size in healthy persons), would be an index more strongly associated with survival than VT or PEEP in patients who are not actively breathing.\\\nMETHODS\\\nUsing a statistical tool known as multilevel mediation analysis to analyze individual data from 3562 patients with ARDS enrolled in nine previously reported randomized trials, we examined \\uc0\\u916 P as an independent variable associated with survival. In the mediation analysis, we estimated the isolated effects of changes in \\u916 P resulting from randomized ventilator settings while minimizing confounding due to the baseline severity of lung disease.\\\nRESULTS\\\nAmong ventilation variables, \\uc0\\u916 P was most strongly associated with survival. A 1-SD increment in \\u916 P (approximately 7 cm of water) was associated with increased mortality (relative risk, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31 to 1.51; P<0.001), even in patients receiving \\'93protective\\'94 plateau pressures and VT (relative risk, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.58; P<0.001). Individual changes in VT or PEEP after randomization were not independently associated with survival; they were associated only if they were among the changes that led to reductions in \\u916 P (mediation effects of \\u916 P, P=0.004 and P=0.001, respectively).\\\nCONCLUSIONS\\\nWe found that \\uc0\\u916 P was the ventilation variable that best stratified risk. Decreases in \\u916 P owing to changes in ventilator settings were strongly associated with increased survival.

However, in patients with ARDS, the proportion of lung available for ventilation is markedly decreased, which is reflected by lower respiratory-system compliance (CRS).13,16\\'9618 Therefore, we hypothesized that normalizing VT to CRS and using the ratio as an index indicating the \\'93functional\\'94 size of the lung would provide a better predictor of outcomes in patients with ARDS than VT alone. This ratio, termed the driving pressure (\\uc0\\u916 P=VT/CRS), can be routinely calculated for patients who are not making inspiratory efforts as the plateau pressure minus PEEP.\\\nTo determine whether data from previous studies are consistent with this hypothesis, we combined individual data from patients involved in nine randomized trials comparing ventilation strategies in patients with ARDS.1,2,10\\'9612,19\\'9622 We used both a standard risk analysis with multivariate adjustments and a multilevel mediation analysis23,24 and examined the extent to which a change in \\uc0\\u916 P (or other variables) resulting from a change in ventilator settings could be statistically linked to effects on survival, independent of the underlying severity of the lung injury and of the specific lung-protection protocol.\\\nMethods\\\nDERIVATION AND VALIDATION COHORTS\\\nWe derived a survival-prediction model with the use of data from a cohort of 336 patients with ARDS from four early randomized clinical trials testing various strategies of volume-limited ventilation.1,19\\'9621 We next tested and refined this model with data from a validation cohort of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
