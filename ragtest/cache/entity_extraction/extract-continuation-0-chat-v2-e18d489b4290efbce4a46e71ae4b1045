At 28 days, the primary outcome was death among patients who did not have a response to a corticotropin test.\nResults\nOf the 499 patients in the study, 233 (46.7%) did not have a response to corticotropin (125 in the hydrocortisone group and 108 in the placebo group). At 28 days, there was no significant difference in mortality between patients in the two study groups who did not have a response to corticotropin (39.2% in the hydrocortisone group and 36.1% in the placebo group, P=0.69) or between those who had a response to corticotropin (28.8% in the hydrocortisone group and 28.7% in the placebo group, P=1.00). At 28 days, 86 of 251 patients in the hydrocortisone group (34.3%) and 78 of 248 patients in the placebo group (31.5%) had died (P=0.51). In the hydrocortisone group, shock was reversed more quickly than in the placebo group. However, there were more episodes of superinfection, including new sepsis and septic shock.\nConclusions\nHydrocortisone did not improve survival or reversal of shock in patients with septic shock, either overall or in patients who did not have a response to corticotropin, although hydrocortisone hastened reversal of shock in patients in whom shock was reversed. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00147004.)\nSevere sepsis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.1,2 Septic shock, the most severe manifestation, occurs in 2 to 20% of inpatients.3 The incidence of the condition has been rising,4 and a death rate of 33 to 61% has been reported in the placebo groups of multicenter trials.5–8\nThe use of corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy has been controversial for decades.9 After the study by Schumer,10 a short course of high-dose corticosteroids became accepted therapy. Subsequent studies, however, did not confirm a survival benefit with this regimen and suggested an increase in superinfection-related mortality.11–13 Studies that have used lower doses of hydrocortisone (200 to 300 mg per day) for longer durations have reported earlier reversal of shock14–18 and improved survival.14,16 The prognostic importance of the response to corticotropin had been recognized in critical illness previously,19,20 and the results in the hydrocortisone studies were particularly apparent in patients who did not have a response to a corticotropin test. Meta-analyses,21,22 reviews,20 and guidelines23 have advocated the use of low-dose hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock. These recommendations were based primarily on a study of patients with septic shock who remained hypotensive after at least 1 hour of resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors.16 In this study, a survival benefit was seen in patients with no response to corticotropin who received hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Our trial, called the Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock (CORTICUS) study, evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy in a broad population of patients with septic shock — in particular, patients who had had a response to a corticotropin test, in whom a benefit was unproven.9\nMethods\nStudy Design\nIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the protocol was approved by the ethics committee at each of the 52 participating intensive care units (ICUs). Patients were enrolled from March 2002 to November 2005, after providing written informed consent. In cases in which a patient lacked mental competency, consent was obtained either from a surrogate, the next of kin, or a legal representative (with retrospective consent obtained from patients who regained competency), according to national regulations. An independent data and safety monitoring board met after each of three interim analyses. At the end of the study, a clinical evaluation committee whose members were unaware of study-group assignments assessed the appropriateness of antiinfective treatments.\nThe authors designed the study, gathered and analyzed the data, and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and the analysis. The sponsors had no role in the design and conduct of the study, in the collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of the data, or in the preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript.\nPatients\nPatients who were 18 years of age or older and had been hospitalized in participating ICUs were prospectively enrolled in the study if they met all eligibility criteria. (For details, see Table 1 of the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org.)
