The data were collected by the investigators and analyzed by the data management committee. The executive committee vouches for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analysis. The article was written by the writing committee, and the decision to publish was made by the executive committee. Full details of the trial protocol can be found in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org.\nStudy Patients\nPatients older than 16 years of age who had septic shock that was resistant to fluids (as defined by lack of response to 500 ml of normal saline or a requirement for vasopressors [see the Supplementary Appendix]) and low-dose norepinephrine were considered for enrollment. Septic shock was defined by the presence of two or more diagnostic criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome,15 proven or suspected infection, new dysfunction of at least one organ, and hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation (requiring vasopressor support consisting of at least 5 μg of norepinephrine or the equivalent per minute [see the Supplementary Appendix] for 6 hours). Exclusion criteria are listed in the Supplementary Appendix.\nTreatment Assignments\nTreatment with either vasopressin or norepinephrine was assigned by means of a central telephone randomization system accessed by the study pharmacists at the participating institutions. A computer-generated randomization list of variable permuted blocks of 2, 4, and 6 was used for treatment allocation, which was stratified by center and by severity of shock in the hour before randomization (the stratum of less severe septic shock was defined as treatment with 5 to 14 μg of norepinephrine or the equivalent per minute, and the stratum of more severe septic shock was defined as treatment with 15 μg or more of norepinephrine or the equivalent per minute). Infusions of both study drugs were prepared locally by study pharmacists who were aware of the two treatments. All other clinical staff, investigators, research personnel, patients, and families were unaware of the treatment assignments for the duration of the trial.\nDrug Infusion\nVasopressin (30 U) and norepinephrine (15 mg) were mixed in identical 250-ml intravenous bags of 5% dextrose in water, with final concentrations of 0.12 U of vasopressin per milliliter and 60 μg of norepinephrine per milliliter. The study-drug infusion was started at 5 ml per hour and increased by 2.5 ml per hour every 10 minutes during the first hour to achieve a constant target rate of 15 ml per hour. Thus, the blinded vasopressin infusion was started at 0.01 U per minute and titrated to a maximum of 0.03 U per minute, whereas the blinded norepinephrine infusion was started at 5 μg per minute and titrated to a maximum of 15 μg per minute.\nDuring the initiation and titration of the study drug, the bedside nurse also titrated open-label vasopressors to maintain a constant target mean arterial pressure. An initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 to 75 mm Hg was recommended; however, the attending ICU physician could modify the target blood pressure of each patient.\nOpen-label vasopressors were increased only if the target mean arterial pressure was not reached on maximal study-drug infusion. Tapering of open-label vasopressors was permitted only when the target mean arterial pressure had been reached during the study-drug infusion. Tapering of the study drug was commenced only when the target mean arterial pressure had been maintained for 8 hours without any open-label vasopressors. Infusion of the study drug was continued at 15 ml per hour until the patient died, a serious adverse event occurred, or the patient's condition improved to the extent that open-label vasopressors were no longer required. Neither crossover to the other group nor open-label vasopressin was permitted.\nThe study-drug infusion was discontinued or interrupted if any of the following predetermined serious adverse events occurred: acute ST-segment elevation confirmed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram, serious or life-threatening (hemodynamically unstable) cardiac arrhythmias, acute mesenteric ischemia, digital ischemia, or hyponatremia (serum sodium level, <130 mmol per liter). If the clinical team noted an adverse event that they considered to be related to the study drug, then the study drug was discontinued for at least 8 hours and a serious adverse event was reported. The study drug could be restarted if, in the judgment of the investigator or attending physician, the adverse event had been treated, the condition had been reversed, and the event was not thought to have been a result of the study drug or study protocol.\nIf vasopressor support was required during the same admission to the ICU after a patient had been weaned from the study drug, the study drug was preferentially reinfused, as long as no exclusion criteria were met. In a subgroup of patients at six of the participating institutions, plasma was collected for measurement of circulating vasopressin levels (see the Supplementary Appendix).\nEnd Points\nThe primary outcome was death from any cause and was assessed 28 days after the start of infusions. Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality; days alive and free of organ dysfunction during the first 28 days according to the Brussels criteria16 (see the Supplementary Appendix); days alive and free of vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy; days alive and free of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, defined as freedom from two or more of the four diagnostic criteria for the systemic inflammatory response\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
