The primary outcome was ICU-free days (days alive and free from the need for intensive care) from randomization to day 28.\nResults\nThe number of ICU-free days to day 28 did not differ significantly between the acetaminophen group and the placebo group: 23 days (interquartile range, 13 to 25) among patients assigned to acetaminophen and 22 days (interquartile range, 12 to 25) among patients assigned to placebo (Hodges–Lehmann estimate of absolute difference, 0 days; 96.2% confidence interval [CI], 0 to 1; P=0.07). A total of 55 of 345 patients in the acetaminophen group (15.9%) and 57 of 344 patients in the placebo group (16.6%) had died by day 90 (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.39; P=0.84).\nConclusions\nEarly administration of acetaminophen to treat fever due to probable infection did not affect the number of ICU-free days. (Funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand and others; HEAT Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12612000513819.)\nAdministration of acetaminophen to lower temperature in patients with fever and probable infection is a frequent intervention in the community and in hospitals. In the intensive care unit (ICU), such treatment is common1,2 and is based on the rationale that fever places additional physiological stress on patients who are already seriously ill.3 Treatment of fever in ICU patients with infection is supported by a recent randomized, controlled trial in which physical cooling of mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock to a normal body temperature was associated with a reduction in vasopressor dose and reduced early mortality.4\nThe common practice of treating fever in patients with infection is challenged by studies showing that fever may enhance immune-cell function,5 inhibit pathogen growth,6–8 and increase the activity of antimicrobial drugs9 and by observational studies showing that higher early fever is associated with a lower risk of death among patients with an ICU admission diagnosis of infection.10,11\nThe lack of high-level evidence12 leaves ICU clinicians uncertain about whether acetaminophen treatment of fever due to probable infection is beneficial, ineffective, or harmful. To address this uncertainty, we conducted a multicenter, blinded, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the hypothesis that administration of intravenous acetaminophen to treat fever would worsen outcomes. Specifically, we hypothesized that, as compared with placebo, acetaminophen would result in fewer ICU-free days (days alive and free from the need for intensive care) in adult ICU patients with fever and probable infection.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nWe conducted an investigator-initiated, prospective, parallel-group, blinded, randomized, controlled trial. The management committee (made up of all the authors) designed the trial, which was endorsed by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group. The George Institute for Global Health (Sydney) and the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand (Wellington) provided subsidized project management and on-site monitoring of data quality for this study. The protocol, which was reported before enrollment commenced13 and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was approved by the New Zealand Multi-region Ethics Committee and by each participating institution. Written informed consent before randomization or delayed consent was obtained from each patient or a legal surrogate, unless an institutional ethics committee approved a waiver of consent (e.g., in the event that a patient died before informed consent could be obtained from a surrogate decision maker). The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of this report to the protocol.\nPatients\nPatients 16 years of age or older with a temperature of 38°C or higher within 12 hours before enrollment and who were receiving antimicrobial therapy for a known or suspected infection were eligible for inclusion. Among the exclusion criteria were acute brain disorders and liver dysfunction that contraindicated the use of acetaminophen. A full list of exclusion criteria is provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.\nRandomization and Study Drugs\nEligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either an infusion containing 1 g of intravenous acetaminophen (Perfalgan, Bristol-Myers Squibb) or an infusion of 5% dextrose in water, every 6 hours. The study medications were packaged in indistinguishable 100-ml glass bottles. Randomization was performed with the use of an encrypted Web-based system involving block randomization with a block size of six and was stratified according to participating center. Investigators were unaware of the randomization block size.\nPatients continued to receive the study drug until 28 days after enrollment or until the occurrence of one of the prespecified cessation criteria: discharge from the ICU, resolution of fever as defined by a prespecified algorithm (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix), cessation of antimicrobial therapy, death, or the development of a contraindication to the study drug.\nRescue physical cooling was permitted if the body temperature rose to 39.5°C or higher.
