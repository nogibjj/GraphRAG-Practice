Second, low doses of a combination of the natural hormone hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were used (as recommended to treat adrenal insufficiency)16 rather than high doses of a synthetic glucocorticoid compound. The addition of fludrocortisone to hydrocortisone was justified because primary adrenal insufficiency could not be ruled out16 since it has been shown that 40% to 65% of critically ill patients have high-plasma renin activity and low-plasma aldosterone concentrations.34,35 Moreover, in situations that require high amounts of active glucocorticoid, the reduction of fludrocortisone to cortisol can serve as a second source of cortisol in addition to that of adrenal glands.36 Third, patients were treated for a longer time (ie, 7 days) than those treated in previous trials. Indeed, recent work in healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin37 and in patients with septic shock23,38 have shown that short courses of corticosteroid treatment may be followed by a rebound of the systemic inflammatory response.\n\nIn conclusion, in catecholamine-dependent septic shock patients, particularly those with relative adrenal insufficiency, a 7-day treatment with the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone is safe and associated with a significant reduction in short-term and long-term mortality. In practice, we suggest that all patients with catecholamine-dependent septic shock should be given the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as soon as a short corticotropin stimulation test is performed. When the results of the test are available, treatment may be withdrawn in responders and continued up to 7 days in nonresponders. Further studies are required to better determine the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroids to be given in this setting. The interest of a replacement therapy with corticosteroids in patients with septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency deserves additional investigation.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
