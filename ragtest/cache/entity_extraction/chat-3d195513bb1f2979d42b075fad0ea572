(For details, see Table 1 of the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org.) Inclusion criteria were clinical evidence of infection, evidence of a systemic response to infection, and the onset of shock within the previous 72 hours (as defined by a systolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg despite adequate fluid replacement or a need for vasopressors for at least 1 hour) and hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction attributable to sepsis. Notable exclusion criteria included underlying disease with a poor prognosis, a life expectancy of less than 24 hours, immunosuppression, and treatment with long-term corticosteroids within the past 6 months or short-term corticosteroids within the past 4 weeks.\nRandomization\nRandomization (in a 1:1 ratio) was stratified according to study center in blocks of four with the use of a computerized random-number generator list provided by a statistician who was not involved in the determination of eligibility, administration of a study drug, or an assessment of outcomes. In each center, the study drug (hydrocortisone or placebo) was sealed in sequentially numbered, identical boxes that contained the entire treatment for each patient to be administered sequentially. The sequence was concealed from the investigators. All patients, medical and nursing staff members, pharmacists, investigators, and members of the monitoring board remained unaware of study-group assignments throughout the study period.\nStudy Drugs\nHydrocortisone (Rotexmedica) was prepared in vials containing 100 mg of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder with ampules containing 2 ml of sterile water diluent; the vials were then coded and masked centrally (Klocke Verpackungs Service). Vials containing placebo were identical to those containing hydrocortisone. The study drugs were administered as a 50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours for 5 days, then tapered to 50 mg intravenously every 12 hours for days 6 to 8, 50 mg every 24 hours for days 9 to 11, and then stopped. A total of 29 doses were given. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of patients were encouraged.24\nDefinitions\nOrgan-system failure was defined for each of the six major organ systems as a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 3 or 4 points (on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 for each organ system, for an aggregate score of 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction).25 Reversal of shock was defined as the maintenance of a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg without vasopressor support for at least 24 hours. Superinfection was defined as a new infection occurring 48 hours or more after the initiation of a study drug.26 New sepsis was defined as a new septic episode with or without microbiologic confirmation. New septic shock was defined as a new episode of septic shock after reversal of the initial episode. The absence of a response to a corticotropin test was defined as an increase in the cortisol level of no more than 9 μg per deciliter (248 nmol per liter). 16\nData Collection\nClinical Evaluation\nThe following data were recorded: general characteristics of the patients, including demographic data, diagnoses, and recent surgery; the severity of illness, as assessed by vital signs, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II (on a scale from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction),27 and the SOFA score25; and interventions, including the type and doses of vasopressors, antibiotics, and adjunctive treatments such as corticosteroids and etomidate.\nLaboratory Measures\nHematologic and chemical data, blood gas analyses, and cultures of blood and other specimens that were obtained from potential sites of infection were recorded. A short corticotropin test was performed with the use of blood samples taken immediately before and 60 minutes after an intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg of cosyntropin (Novartis or Alliance). After centrifugation, serum samples were stored at a temperature no higher than −20°C until assayed. To reduce heterogeneity in the determination of cortisol levels, all samples were measured blindly and serially before interim and final analyses in a central laboratory with the use of the Elecsys cortisol assay (Roche Diagnostics).\nFollow-up\nDuring the 28-day period after randomization, data were collected regarding vital signs, results from laboratory tests and cultures of specimens drawn from any new site of infection, and any major interventions that were performed. Rates of death at 28 days, in the ICU, in the hospital, and at 1 year after randomization were recorded.\nEnd Points\nThe primary end point was the rate of death at 28 days in patients who did not have a response to corticotropin. Secondary end points were the rates of death at 28 days in patients who had a response to corticotropin and in all patients, the rates of death in the ICU and in the hospital, the rates of death at 1 year after randomization, a reversal of organ system failure (including shock), and the duration of the stay in the ICU and the hospital.\nSafety was assessed by recording adverse events, particularly superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, clinical muscular weakness, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and peripheral ischemia. Methods to enhance the quality of measurements included holding\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
