However, whether this blood-pressure target is more or less effective than a higher target is unknown.\nMethods\nIn a multicenter, open-label trial, we randomly assigned 776 patients with septic shock to undergo resuscitation with a mean arterial pressure target of either 80 to 85 mm Hg (high-target group) or 65 to 70 mm Hg (low-target group). The primary end point was mortality at day 28.\nResults\nAt 28 days, there was no significant between-group difference in mortality, with deaths reported in 142 of 388 patients in the high-target group (36.6%) and 132 of 388 patients in the low-target group (34.0%) (hazard ratio in the high-target group, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.38; P=0.57). There was also no significant difference in mortality at 90 days, with 170 deaths (43.8%) and 164 deaths (42.3%), respectively (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.30; P=0.74). The occurrence of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups (74 events [19.1%] and 69 events [17.8%], respectively; P=0.64). However, the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation was higher in the high-target group than in the low-target group. Among patients with chronic hypertension, those in the high-target group required less renal-replacement therapy than did those in the low-target group, but such therapy was not associated with a difference in mortality.\nConclusions\nTargeting a mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg, as compared with 65 to 70 mm Hg, in patients with septic shock undergoing resuscitation did not result in significant differences in mortality at either 28 or 90 days. (Funded by the French Ministry of Health; SEPSISPAM ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01149278.)\nSeptic shock is characterized by arterial hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation. The guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign1 recommended initial resuscitation with vasopressors to reverse hypotension, with a mean arterial pressure target of at least 65 mm Hg (grade 1C, indicating a strong recommendation with a low level of evidence). This recommendation is based on the findings of small studies, which showed no significant differences in lactate levels or regional blood flow when the mean arterial pressure was elevated to more than 65 mm Hg in patients with septic shock. 2,3\nHowever, as emphasized by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, for patients with atherosclerosis or previous hypertension, a higher blood-pressure target may be better. Accordingly, values for mean arterial pressure exceeding 65 mm Hg are frequently observed, as confirmed by data from large, prospective, randomized, controlled trials that focused on resuscitation of patients with septic shock, which showed that patients had mean arterial pressures in the range of 75 to 95 mm Hg 24 hours after inclusion.4–8 Moreover, a large, retrospective study showed that a mean arterial pressure of more than 75 mm Hg may be required to maintain kidney function.9 The notion that a higher blood pressure can be useful was confirmed in a small, prospective, observational study.10 Finally, a study of physiological mechanisms of chronic arterial hypertension showed that such hypertension causes a rightward shift in cerebral pressure-flow autoregulation, which might justify targeting a higher mean arterial pressure.11\nSince the selection of effective blood-pressure targets is still controversial, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, stratified, open-label trial involving patients with septic shock to determine whether targeting a mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg would decrease 28-day mortality, as compared with targeting a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 70 mm Hg. We also postulated that the beneficial effects of a higher target would be more pronounced among patients with chronic hypertension. Therefore, at randomization, patients were stratified according to whether they had a history of chronic hypertension.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nFrom March 2010 through December 2011, we enrolled patients at 29 centers in France. The study was approved for all centers by the ethics committee at the Angers University Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, their next of kin, or another surrogate decision maker, as appropriate. If patients were unable to provide informed consent and neither their next of kin nor other designated person was available, a procedure for inclusion in the study in emergency situations was applied. A definitive post hoc consent form was ultimately obtained from patients who survived but had been initially treated on the basis of the emergency consent.\nRandomization was performed with the use of a computer-generated assignment sequence in a centralized, blinded fashion and was stratified according to whether patients had chronic hypertension (i.e., had been receiving antihypertensive treatment or had a history of arterial hypertension). Given the pragmatic character of the trial, it was impossible to obtain details on the patients' adherence to the antihypertensive drug regimen or the adequacy of the antihypertensive treatment during the inclusion time window. Patients, research staff members, and members of the safety and writing committees were unaware of the study-group assignments.\nStudy Oversight\nThe data and safety monitoring committee oversaw the trial conduct and the safety of the patients, with interim analyses performed after the inclusion of 200, 400, and 600 patients.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A campaign that recommends targeting a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg during initial resuscitation of patients with septic shock)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A condition characterized by arterial hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH MINISTRY OF HEALTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization that funded the SEPSISPAM trial, which investigates mean arterial pressure targets in septic shock resuscitation)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPSISPAM<|>EVENT<|>A multicenter, open-label trial to determine the effectiveness of different mean arterial pressure targets during resuscitation of patients with septic shock)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>Country where the SEPSISPAM trial was conducted across 29 centers)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANGERS UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institution whose ethics committee approved the SEPSISPAM trial)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign provides guidelines for the resuscitation of patients with septic shock<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEPSISPAM<|>FRENCH MINISTRY OF HEALTH<|>The SEPSISPAM trial was funded by the French Ministry of Health<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEPSISPAM<|>FRANCE<|>The SEPSISPAM trial was conducted across 29 centers in France<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEPSISPAM<|>ANGERS UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL<|>The ethics committee at Angers University Hospital approved the SEPSISPAM trial<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEPSISPAM<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>The SEPSISPAM trial investigates the recommendations made by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign regarding mean arterial pressure targets<|>7)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
