Consistent with at least 14 previous trials in humans10–14,20–28 of low-dose vasopressin (≤0.1 U per minute), vasopressin infusion allowed a rapid decrease in the total norepinephrine dose while maintaining mean arterial pressure.10–12,29\nOur study was prospectively powered to detect an absolute difference in mortality of 10% from an expected 60%. However, the observed mortality rates in both the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups were considerably lower than those in previous studies, perhaps because of overall improvements in the care of patients who have septic shock. Nonetheless, our data exclude with 95% confidence a harm associated with the use of vasopressin that was greater than 2.9% or a benefit that was greater than 10.7%.\nThe overall rates of serious adverse events were approximately 10% each in the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups. Previous studies raised the possibility that vasopressin infusion may increase the incidence of cardiac arrest.29 In contrast, we found that of 11 cardiac arrests reported in this study, 8 occurred in the norepinephrine group and 3 occurred in the vasopressin group. Our selection of a low dose of vasopressin (0.03 U per minute) and careful exclusion of patients who had acute coronary syndromes or severe heart failure could account for the lack of adverse cardiovascular effects of vasopressin infusion. If vasopressin becomes routine therapy and is given at higher doses or to patients with septic shock who have coexisting heart disease, the adverse reactions to vasopressin could be increased. Other reported adverse effects of vasopressin and norepinephrine include decreased cardiac output,11,14,29 mesenteric ischemia,21,30 hyponatremia (with vasopressin only), skin necrosis,31 and digital ischemia.32 More patients in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group had digital ischemia; one patient in the vasopressin group required surgical intervention.\nOur secondary hypothesis was that the beneficial effects of vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine would be more pronounced in the subgroup of patients with more severe septic shock. No significant interaction between treatment group and shock-severity subgroup (as defined a priori) was shown. Some of the analyses we performed suggested that vasopressin may be more beneficial in patients with less severe septic shock. However, the statistical significance of these observations is uncertain, especially because of the many statistical tests performed, and this finding should be considered only as a hypothesis-generating concept to be tested in future trials.33\nSeveral limitations of our trial should be mentioned. The vasopressin was infused over a set range of doses, and we did not measure vasopressin levels as a guide to the dose or the duration of infusion. In addition, in this trial the mean arterial pressure at baseline was 72 to 73 mm Hg, essentially making this a study of the effects of low-dose vasopressin as a “catecholamine-sparing drug,” not an evaluation of vasopressin in patients with catecholamine-unresponsive refractory shock. The mean time from meeting the criteria for study entry to infusion of the study drug (12 hours) was greater than the period that Rivers and colleagues4 identified as being important in early goal-directed therapy (6 hours), which may be one reason that we did not find a benefit of vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine.\nIn summary, we evaluated the effect of low-dose vasopressin (0.03 U per minute) when used in conjunction with catecholamine vasopressors in patients with septic shock. We did not find a significant reduction in mortality rates with vasopressin.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VASOPRESSIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vasopressin is studied for its effects in reducing norepinephrine dose while maintaining arterial pressure in septic shock patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOREPINEPHRINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Norepinephrine is compared with vasopressin in a study to evaluate its effectiveness in septic shock patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>Septic shock is the condition being studied, focusing on the effectiveness of vasopressin versus norepinephrine in patient treatment)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VASOPRESSIN<|>NOREPINEPHRINE<|>Vasopressin was studied in comparison to norepinephrine for its effects on septic shock patients<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VASOPRESSIN<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>Vasopressin was evaluated for its potential benefits in treating septic shock<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOREPINEPHRINE<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>Norepinephrine's effectiveness in septic shock treatment was evaluated alongside vasopressin<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
