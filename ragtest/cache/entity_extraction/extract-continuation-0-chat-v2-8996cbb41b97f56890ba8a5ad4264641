We did not administer fludrocortisone, because it has been shown previously to be ineffective.36\nOur trial had limitations. Within the context of a large pragmatic trial, we collected data on only adverse events that had been judged by the treating clinicians to be related to the trial regimen, and we did not adjudicate this judgment. This approach may weaken the inferences about adverse events. We did not collect data regarding all possible secondary infections, and we recorded only bacteremia and fungemia, which are less subject to diagnostic error or ascertainment bias. We did not adjudicate the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. We used rates of recurrence of ventilation as a surrogate for myopathy but did not assess long-term neuromuscular weakness.\nOur trial provides evidence about the role of hydrocortisone as an adjunctive treatment in patients with septic shock. Although we did not observe a significant difference between the hydrocortisone group and the placebo group with regard to 90-day mortality, some secondary outcomes were better in the group that received the active treatment. Our observation of the hemodynamic effects of hydrocortisone is consistent with those in previous studies.37-39 These hemodynamic effects may represent a beneficial role of hydrocortisone. There was a lower incidence of transfusion in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group, a finding that may be regarded as hypothesis-generating. A detailed costâ€“benefit assessment of these results was not done, but such an analysis may inform clinicians about the overall cost-effectiveness of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock.\nIn conclusion, in patients with septic shock who were undergoing mechanical ventilation, the administration of a continuous infusion of hydrocortisone did not result in lower mortality at 90 days than placebo.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hydrocortisone is discussed as an adjunctive treatment in patients with septic shock, with observations on its hemodynamic effects and comparison to placebo in terms of mortality and secondary outcomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A condition under study in the trial, where the role of hydrocortisone as a treatment was evaluated, particularly its effects on mortality and other health outcomes in patients)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>Hydrocortisone was studied as a treatment for septic shock, with its effects on patient outcomes like mortality and hemodynamic stability being evaluated<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
