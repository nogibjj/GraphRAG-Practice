Values for total fluid administration and total urine output during the 5 days specified in the protocol were similar in the two study groups (Table S2B in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 2\n\nClinical Results, Primary and Secondary Outcomes, and Serious Adverse Events.\nPrimary Outcome\nAt 28 days, there was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death, with deaths reported in 142 of 388 patients (36.6%) in the high-target group and 132 of 388 patients (34.0%) in the low-target group (hazard ratio in the high-target group, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.38; P=0.57). There was also no significant between-group difference in mortality at 90 days, with 170 deaths (43.7%) and 164 deaths (42.3%), in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.30; P=0.74) (Table 2 and Figure 3).\nFigure 3\n\nKaplanâ€“Meier Curves for Cumulative Survival.\nIn addition, there were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes: need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU and hospital, and the SOFA score by day 7 (Table 2, and Tables S2C and S2D in the Supplementary Appendix). However, in patients with chronic arterial hypertension, there was a significant interaction between study group and hypertension stratum with respect to the doubling of the blood creatinine level (P=0.009) and with respect to the need for renal-replacement therapy (P=0.04). Multivariate logistic-regression analysis indicated that none of the potentially nephrotoxic therapies influenced this result.\nAdverse Events\nThere was no significant difference between the two study groups in the overall incidence of serious adverse events (P=0.64) (Table 2, and Table S2E in the Supplementary Appendix). Although the total number of cardiac adverse events did not differ between the groups, the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation was significantly higher in the high-target group, with events reported in 26 patients (6.7%) in the high-target group and 11 patients (2.8%) in the low-target group (P=0.02). The frequencies of ischemic events and bleeding complications were similar in the two study groups.\nDiscussion\nIn this multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we compared the strategy of targeting a high mean arterial pressure (80 to 85 mm Hg) with the strategy of targeting a low pressure (65 to 70 mm Hg) in patients with septic shock. The high-target group received significantly higher doses of vasopressor catecholamines over a significantly longer time period, but we found no significant difference in 28-day mortality. There was no significant between-group difference in early fluid balance, and the fluid balance was lower than those reported previously,7,8 possibly because our population of patients differed from those in previous studies or because of more restrictive protocols for fluid administration in France. In addition, there were no significant between-group differences in the overall rates of organ dysfunction or death at 90 days. However, in patients with a history of chronic arterial hypertension, targeting a mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg reduced both the incidence of a doubling of the blood creatinine level and the rate of renal-replacement therapy. There was no significant between-group difference in the overall rate of serious adverse events, but patients in the high-target group had significantly more episodes of atrial fibrillation.\nNo differences in the primary and secondary outcomes were observed between the two groups. Our study was prospectively powered to detect an absolute difference of 10 percentage points in the rate of death on the basis of an expected rate of 45% in the low-target group, at an alpha level of 0.05 and a beta level of 0.20, with the use of a two-tailed test. The expected overall death rate in our study was consistent with the rates among patients with septic shock that were reported in previous multicenter trials (37%,5 39%,8 47%,4 and 49%6) at the time the trial was designed. The absolute reduction of 10 percentage points in mortality was chosen in our study because the trials that were available in the literature when the protocol was designed in 2008 had tested the hypothesis of absolute reductions of 20 percentage points,5 15 percentage points,4 and 10 percentage points8 in rates of death. Two other trials that were published after we started recruiting patients tested the hypothesis of an absolute mortality reduction of 7 percentage points7,15 and 10 percentage points.16 Hence, the anticipated risk reduction in our study was close to the risk reductions tested in previous studies. However, our observed rate of death at 28 days was lower than the rate in some other studies, although it was in line with the rate in more recent trials, in which death rates ranging from 25 to 57% were reported.7,15 Nevertheless, the lower-than-expected rate of death led to an underpowered study. Therefore, we may not have detected differences in the incidence of some adverse events, especially rare events such as myocardial infarction.\nSeptic shock is a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation,17 and in our study, atrial fibrillation was significantly more common in the high-target group than in the low-target group. This adverse effect might be related to the significantly higher doses of catecholamine and the longer duration of catech\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE<|>EVENT<|>Mean arterial pressure was targeted at 65 to 70 mm Hg to avoid adverse effects in a study comparing high-target and low-target strategies in septic shock patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A condition where the study focused on comparing different mean arterial pressure targets to observe outcomes in patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VASOPRESSOR CATECHOLAMINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Drugs used in the high-target group to maintain a higher mean arterial pressure in septic shock patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATRIAL FIBRILLATION<|>EVENT<|>A cardiac adverse event that was significantly more common in the high-target group of the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENAL-REPLACEMENT THERAPY<|>EVENT<|>A treatment for kidney failure that was less needed in patients with chronic arterial hypertension in the high-target group)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>The study aimed to maintain mean arterial pressure within a specific range for patients with septic shock<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VASOPRESSOR CATECHOLAMINES<|>ATRIAL FIBRILLATION<|>Higher doses of vasopressor catecholamines in the high-target group were associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>ATRIAL FIBRILLATION<|>Patients with septic shock in the high-target group experienced more atrial fibrillation due to the treatment strategy<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RENAL-REPLACEMENT THERAPY<|>MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE<|>Targeting a higher mean arterial pressure reduced the need for renal-replacement therapy in patients with chronic arterial hypertension<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
