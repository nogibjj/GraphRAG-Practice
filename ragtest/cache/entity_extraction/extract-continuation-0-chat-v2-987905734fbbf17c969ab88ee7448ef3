A breakdown of specific adverse events is presented in Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nDiscussion\nIn this randomized trial conducted in a variety of health care settings, we found that EGDT, as compared with usual care, did not reduce the primary outcome of 90-day all-cause mortality, either overall or in any of the prespecified subgroups, among patients with early septic shock who presented to the emergency department. There were also no significant differences in 28-day or in-hospital mortality, duration of organ support, or length of hospital stay.\nAdherence to the algorithm-directed therapies was very high, and the potentially confounding effect of the time to the administration of antimicrobial drugs was addressed by the requirement that such drugs be administered before randomization. In addition, the loss to follow-up was minimal. The statistical analysis plan was published before recruitment was completed, which eliminated the potential for analytical bias.28 Although the trial could not be blinded because of the practical requirements of EGDT, the risk of bias was minimized through central randomization, concealment of study-group assignments before randomization to avoid selection bias, and the use of a robust primary outcome that would not be subject to observer bias. The results also have a high degree of external validity, since participating sites were representative of all regions across Australia and New Zealand, including metropolitan and rural centers, with a mix of EGDT implementation models based in the emergency department, ICU, or both.\nThe rate of death in our study was lower than that reported in the original EGDT trial.11 This finding is consistent with data showing that in-hospital mortality for patients who are admitted to ICUs with severe sepsis and septic shock has been reduced by 1 percentage point per year during the past two decades, with the decline beginning before the introduction of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. 4,8,33 Although our study had entry criteria similar to those in the ProCESS study and the original EGDT trial, it is possible that the patients in our study had a reduced risk of death because of low rates of chronic disease and better functional status, as evidenced by the low proportion of nursing home residents before randomization. Nonetheless, the number of patients with septic shock at the time of enrollment was high, indicating that the target population was enrolled. The high number of patients who were discharged home may also support the small increment in mortality between hospital discharge and 90 days. There was no trend suggesting an effect of EGDT in any unadjusted or adjusted estimates of mortality, and subgroup analyses did not indicate that the benefit from EGDT increased with the severity of illness. Although contamination of the usual-care group by the incorporation of some elements of the EGDT protocol into usual care may have biased the study results, significant differences in EGDT-specific treatments that were administered in the two groups and the similarity between therapies administered in the usual-care group in this study and those in our pretrial observational study25 indicate that such an effect in the usual-care group is unlikely.\nOur findings agree with those of the ProCESS trial,10 in which investigators also used a resuscitation algorithm that was similar to that used in the original EGDT trial.11 Although our results differ from those in the original trial, they are consistent with previous studies showing that bias in small, single-center trials may lead to inflated effect sizes34 that cannot be replicated in larger, multicenter studies.35–37 Although the ProCESS study did not directly compare protocol-based EGDT for resuscitation with care that was not protocol-based, the concordance of results between our study and the ProCESS study suggests that EGDT does not offer a survival advantage in patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock. Whether resuscitation protocols with different goals or different individual therapies in the EGDT bundle offer a survival benefit remains to be determined.\nIn conclusion, the results of our trial show that EGDT, as compared with usual resuscitation practice, did not decrease mortality among patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock. Our findings suggest that the value of incorporating EGDT into international guidelines as a standard of care is questionable.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGDT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Early Goal-Directed Therapy, a resuscitation protocol for patients with early septic shock compared against usual care in a randomized trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USUAL CARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Standard resuscitation practice for patients with early septic shock, compared against EGDT in a randomized trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>One of the countries where the randomized trial comparing EGDT and usual care was conducted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW ZEALAND<|>GEO<|>One of the countries where the randomized trial comparing EGDT and usual care was conducted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A global initiative aimed at reducing mortality from sepsis and septic shock, mentioned in the context of historical improvements in patient outcomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>A study that used a resuscitation algorithm similar to EGDT for patients with septic shock, its results are compared with those of the EGDT trial)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>USUAL CARE<|>EGDT was compared against usual care in a randomized trial to assess its effectiveness in reducing mortality among patients with early septic shock<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>NEW ZEALAND<|>Both countries participated in the randomized trial comparing EGDT and usual care<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>The effectiveness of EGDT, which could influence international guidelines, is questioned in the context of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT<|>PROCESS TRIAL<|>The results of the EGDT trial are compared with those of the ProCESS trial, suggesting similar conclusions about the effectiveness of EGDT<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
