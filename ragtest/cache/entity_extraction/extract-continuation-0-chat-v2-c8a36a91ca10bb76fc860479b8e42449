Adverse events were categorized as arrhythmias (i.e., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or atrial fibrillation), myocardial necrosis, skin necrosis, ischemia in limbs or distal extremities, or secondary infections.17\nMeasured Variables\nThe following data were recorded every 6 hours for 48 hours, every 8 hours on days 3, 4, and 5, and once a day on days 6, 7, 14, 21, and 28: vital signs, hemodynamic variables (including systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, heart rate, central venous pressure, and, when possible, pulmonary-artery pressures), cardiac output, arterial and mixed-venous (or central venous) blood gas levels, doses of vasoactive agents, and respiratory conditions. Biologic variables, data on daily fluid balance, microbiologic data, and antibiotic therapy were recorded daily for the first 7 days and then on days 14, 21, and 28.\nThe Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score18 was calculated at the time of admission to the ICU and at the time of enrollment in the study, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score19 was calculated daily for the first 7 days and then on days 14, 21, and 28.\nStatistical Analysis\nOn the basis of the results of the SOAP study,3 which showed a rate of death of 43% among patients receiving dopamine and a rate of 36% among patients receiving norepinephrine, we estimated that with 765 patients in each group, the study would have 80% power to show a 15% relative difference in the rate of death at 28 days, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.\nSince the magnitude of the effect derived from observational studies can be misleading, we opted for a sequential trial design with two-sided alternatives20; the trial design called for analyses to be performed after inclusion of the first 50 and 100 patients, and then after inclusion of each additional 100 patients, and allowed for the discontinuation of the trial according to the following predefined boundaries: superiority of norepinephrine over dopamine, superiority of dopamine over norepinephrine, or no difference between the two. An independent statistician who is also a physician monitored the efficacy analyses and the adverse events; on October 6, 2007, after analysis of the outcome in the first 1600 patients showed that one of the three predefined boundaries had been crossed, the statistician advised that the trial be stopped.\nAll data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Differences in the primary outcome were analyzed with the use of an unadjusted chi-square test. Results are presented as absolute and relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Kaplan–Meier curves for estimated survival were compared with the use of a log-rank test. A Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to evaluate the influence of potential confounding factors on the outcome (factors were selected if the P value in the univariate analysis was <0.20).\nA predefined subgroup analysis of the primary outcome was conducted according to the type of shock (septic, cardiogenic, or hypovolemic). A test for interaction was performed, and the results are presented in a forest plot.\nOther binary end points were analyzed with the use of chi-square tests, and continuous variables were compared by means of an unpaired Student's t-test or a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate, with the use of SPSS software, version 13.0 (SPSS). All reported P values are two-sided and have not been adjusted for multiple testing. The study statistician and investigators remained unaware of the patients' treatment assignments while they performed the final analyses.\nResults\nPatients\nA total of 1679 patients were enrolled — 858 in the dopamine group and 821 in the norepinephrine group (Figure 1). All patients were followed to day 28; data on the outcome during the stay in the hospital were available for 1656 patients (98.6%), data on the 6-month outcome for 1443 patients (85.9%), and data on the 12-month outcome for 1036 patients (61.7%). There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to most of the baseline characteristics (Table 1); there were small differences, which were of questionable clinical relevance, in the heart rate, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2). The type of shock that was seen most frequently was septic shock (in 1044 patients [62.2%]), followed by cardiogenic shock (in 280 patients [16.7%]) and hypovolemic shock (in 263 patients [15.7%]). The sources of sepsis are detailed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Hydrocortisone was administered in 344 patients who received dopamine (40.1%) and in 326 patients who received norepinephrine (39.7%). Among patients with septic shock, recombinant activated human protein C was administered in 102 patients in the dopamine group (18.8%) and 96 patients in the norepinephrine group (19.1%).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening and Enrollment.\nTable 1\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients and Major Therapeutic Interventions at Baseline.\nData on hemodynamic variables and doses of vasoactive agents are shown in Figure 3 and Figure\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DOBUTAMINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dobutamine is mentioned as one of the inotropic agents used in the context of the study, implying its relevance in medical treatment or research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRHYTHMIAS<|>EVENT<|>Arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or atrial fibrillation, are categorized as adverse events in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYOCARDIAL NECROSIS<|>EVENT<|>Myocardial necrosis is listed as an adverse event, indicating tissue death in the myocardium due to insufficient blood supply)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKIN NECROSIS<|>EVENT<|>Skin necrosis is identified as an adverse event, referring to the death of skin tissue)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISCHMIA IN LIMBS<|>EVENT<|>Ischemia in limbs or distal extremities is mentioned as an adverse event, indicating reduced blood flow to these areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECONDARY INFECTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Secondary infections are categorized as adverse events, implying infections that occur during or after treatment for another condition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APACHE II<|>ORGANIZATION<|>APACHE II score is a severity-of-disease classification system, calculated at the time of ICU admission and enrollment in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFA SCORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, calculated daily for the first 7 days and then on specified days, is used to track a patient's status during hospital stay)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOAP STUDY<|>EVENT<|>SOAP study is referenced for its findings on death rates among patients receiving dopamine versus norepinephrine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOREPINEPHRINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Norepinephrine is compared to dopamine in the study, with a focus on its effects on patient outcomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOPAMINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dopamine is a medication used in the study, its effects and outcomes are analyzed and compared to those of norepinephrine)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARRHYTHMIAS<|>DOBUTAMINE<|>Arrhythmias are listed as potential adverse events, which could be related to the use of dobutamine or other agents<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYOCARDIAL NECROSIS<|>DOPAMINE<|>Myocardial necrosis is an adverse event that could be associated with the use of dopamine in the study<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOAP STUDY<|>NOREPINEPHRINE<|>The SOAP study's findings on death rates among patients receiving norepinephrine versus dopamine influenced the study's design and hypotheses<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOAP STUDY<|>DOPAMINE<|>The SOAP study's findings on death rates among patients receiving dopamine versus norepinephrine influenced the study's design and hypotheses<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
