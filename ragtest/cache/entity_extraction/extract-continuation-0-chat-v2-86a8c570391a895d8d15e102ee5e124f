Assuming that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect a disease continuum, it was hypothesized that early hydrocortisone administration might prevent shock development owing to the attenuation of an exaggerated inflammatory response. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT investigating the effects of hydrocortisone to prevent progression to shock in patients with severe sepsis presenting without shock.\n\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThe Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Septic Shock (HYPRESS) study is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The study was conducted in cooperation with the German Sepsis Competence Network (SepNet) and the Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig, which provided internet-based randomization and data capture, assurance of accuracy and completeness of data, biostatistical analysis, and pharmacovigilance. Monitoring of sites was performed on defined intervals. The protocol was approved by the responsible ethics committees of all 34 participating sites. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 2.\n\nStudy Patients\nPatients were screened in intermediate care units or intensive care units (ICUs) of university and community hospitals for eligibility, and written informed consent was obtained from patients, patient-authorized representatives, or legal representatives. Patients were enrolled if they met all inclusion criteria (for details, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1): (1) provided informed consent; (2) had evidence of infection; (3) had evidence of a systemic response to infection, defined as at least 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria12; and (4) had evidence of organ dysfunction present for not longer than 48 hours. The main exclusion criterion was septic shock. Other exclusion criteria were being younger than 18 years, having known hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or mannitol (placebo), or having a history of glucocorticoid medication with indication for continuation of therapy or other indications for treatment with glucocorticoids. Patients were not excluded for using etomidate within 72 hours before enrollment, using a short course of glucocorticoids within 72 hours before enrollment, or using topical or inhaled glucocorticoids.\n\nDefinitions\nSeptic shock was defined as sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate volume status for longer than 4 hours (ie, mean arterial pressure <65 mm Hg, systolic arterial pressure <90 mm Hg, or the use of vasopressors to keep mean arterial pressure ≥65 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressure ≥90 mm Hg). Patients who had a transient need for vasopressors during initial resuscitation but were not hypotensive and did not use vasopressors for at least 2 hours were eligible for enrollment when septic shock was not present at the time of randomization. Adequate volume status was defined as a central venous pressure of 8 mm Hg or greater (≥12 mm Hg in ventilated patients) and a central venous oxygen saturation greater than 70%. For fluid replacement, patients were to receive at least 500 to 1000 mL of crystalloids or 300 to 500 mL of colloids over 30 minutes. The use of hydroxyethyl starch preparations was discouraged owing to possible harmful effects on kidney function.13,14 Use of vasopressors was defined as therapy with dopamine at a dosage of at least 5 µg/kg/min or with any dose of epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, or other vasopressors. For further details and definitions, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.\n\nRandomization\nRandomization was stratified by participating center and sex. It was performed with an internet-based computerized randomization tool that uses a modified version of the Pocock minimization algorithm15 with a random component to generate balanced 1:1 randomization in the strata at any time. All patients, study personnel, sponsors, medical staff, and nursing staff were blinded regarding the allocation of study medication throughout the entire study period.\n\nStudy Medication\nThe study medication (hydrocortisone and placebo) was produced and released by BAG Health Care GmbH. The medication was delivered in boxes, each containing 17 brown glass vials for 1 patient. Each vial contained 100 mg of lyophilized hydrocortisone hydrogen succinate or the same amount of lyophilized mannitol as placebo, which was indistinguishable from hydrocortisone. The medication was administered as an intravenous bolus of 50 mg, followed by a 24-hour continuous infusion of 200 mg on 5 days, 100 mg on days 6 and 7, 50 mg on days 8 and 9, and 25 mg on days 10 and 11. Hydrocortisone dose corresponded to those used in the 2 major RCTs performed earlier,3,4 which had shown significant effects on septic shock resolution. A continuous infusion was preferred to avoid possible undulation of the blood cortisol concentrations by bolus administration, which had been reported to complicate blood glucose control.16 A continuous infusion was also recommended in the recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.2 To reduce possible hemodynamic and immunological rebound effects,17 hydrocortisone was tapered over several days as in the CORTICUS study.4 Study medication was discontinued for safety reasons or when patients were discharged from the ICU or reached the primary end point.\n\nEnd Points\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hydrocortisone is studied for its effects on preventing shock in patients with severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) through early administration to attenuate an exaggerated inflammatory response)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPRESS STUDY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Septic Shock (HYPRESS) study is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, conducted in cooperation with the German Sepsis Competence Network and the Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMAN FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supports the HYPRESS study, which investigates the effects of hydrocortisone on preventing progression to shock in patients with severe sepsis)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMAN SEPSIS COMPETENCE NETWORK (SEPNET)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cooperates in the HYPRESS study, which is focused on the prevention of septic shock through the administration of hydrocortisone)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLINICAL TRIAL CENTRE LEIPZIG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provides internet-based randomization, data capture, biostatistical analysis, and pharmacovigilance for the HYPRESS study)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPRESS STUDY<|>GERMAN FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH<|>The HYPRESS study is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPRESS STUDY<|>GERMAN SEPSIS COMPETENCE NETWORK (SEPNET)<|>The HYPRESS study is conducted in cooperation with the German Sepsis Competence Network<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYPRESS STUDY<|>CLINICAL TRIAL CENTRE LEIPZIG<|>The Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig provides essential services for the HYPRESS study<|>9)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
