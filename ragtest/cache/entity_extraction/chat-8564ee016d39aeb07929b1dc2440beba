Treatment assignments were concealed from the investigators assessing mortality, the data and safety monitoring committee, and the trial statistician. The conduct of the trial and the safety of the participants were overseen by the data and safety monitoring committee, which performed an interim analysis after 500 patients had been followed for 90 days. The trial data were monitored by staff from the coordinating center.\nTrial Patients\nWe screened patients 18 years of age or older who were in the ICU, fulfilled the criteria for septic shock,18 and had a blood concentration of hemoglobin of 9 g per deciliter or less as measured by means of valid point-of-care testing (see the Supplementary Appendix). The reasons for the exclusion of some patients are shown in Figure 1 and listed in the Supplementary Appendix.\nFigure 1\n\nAssessment, Randomization, and Follow-up.\nIntervention\nEnrolled patients were given single units of cross-matched, prestorage leukoreduced red cells suspended in a saline–adenine–glucose–mannitol solution when the blood concentration of hemoglobin had decreased to the assigned transfusion threshold (≤7 g per deciliter [lower threshold] or ≤9 g per deciliter [higher threshold]). These levels of hemoglobin have frequently been used as thresholds for transfusion in patients with septic shock.15 Hemoglobin concentrations were reassessed within 3 hours after termination of the transfusion or before the initiation of another transfusion. The intervention period was the entire ICU stay, to a maximum of 90 days after randomization.\nIn the event that life-threatening bleeding or ischemia developed while a patient was in the ICU or a patient required the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the patient could receive a transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold decided by the attending doctor. The attending doctor decided when the patient again was to receive a transfusion at the assigned hemoglobin threshold. After the unmasking of trial data showing harm from hydroxyethyl starch,3 we recommended against the use of all starch products in trial patients. All other interventions were at the discretion of the clinicians, including transfusion during surgery and after ICU discharge.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary outcome measure was death by 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcome measures were the use of life support (defined as the use of vasopressor or inotropic therapy, mechanical ventilation, or renal-replacement therapy) at days 5, 14, and 28 after randomization19; the number of patients with serious adverse reactions while in the ICU (allergic reaction, hemolysis, transfusion-associated acute lung injury, or transfusion-associated circulatory overload) (see the Supplementary Appendix); the number of patients with ischemic events while in the ICU, which included cerebral ischemia (identified from the results of imaging), acute myocardial ischemia (defined by symptoms, electrocardiographic signs, or elevated biomarker levels resulting in an intervention), intestinal ischemia (as observed during endoscopic examination or surgery), or limb ischemia (defined as clinical signs resulting in an intervention) (for full definitions, see the Supplementary Appendix); the percentage of days alive without vasopressor or inotropic therapy, mechanical ventilation, or renal-replacement therapy in the 90 days after randomization; and the percentage of days alive and out of the hospital in the 90 days after randomization. Data for the outcome measures were obtained by TRISS trial investigators or their delegates from patient files and national and regional registries for the entire 90-day follow-up period.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe calculated that we would need to enroll 1000 patients for the trial to have 80% power to show mortality at 90 days that was 9 percentage points lower in the lower-threshold group than in the higher-threshold group, at a two-sided alpha level of 5%, assuming a mortality in the higher-threshold group of 45% (estimated from two previous cohorts).20,21 The estimated difference of 9 percentage points was derived from the 20% reduction in relative risk observed with a restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy in the subgroup of patients with severe infection in the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial.9 During our trial, 5 patients were excluded after randomization (4 patients did not allow the use of their data, and 1 did not have sepsis, which was realized immediately after randomization). A total of 5 additional patients underwent randomization in order for the study to obtain the full sample (Figure 1).\nAn author who was the statistician for the study and who was unaware of the study-group assignments performed all the analyses according to International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines22 and the statistical analysis plan.15 We performed the primary analyses in the intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who underwent randomization, except for those whose data were deleted from the database during the trial (i.e., the 5 patients, noted above, who were excluded after randomization) and after the trial (2 patients who withdrew consent for the use of their data) (Figure 1). In the per-protocol populations, we excluded patients who had one or more bleeding or ischemic episodes or one or more major protocol violations (see the Supplementary Appendix).22\nIn the primary analyses (including the analysis of the primary outcome measure), we compared data between the two groups by means of logistic-regression analysis for binary outcome\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
