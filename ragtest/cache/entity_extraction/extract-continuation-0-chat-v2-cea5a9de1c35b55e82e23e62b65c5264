Finally, we retested the model with data from a more recent validation cohort of 2365 patients with ARDS enrolled in four randomized trials comparing higher-PEEP versus lower-PEEP strategies4,10\\'9612,22 (Table 1, and Tables S1 and S2 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\\\nTABLE 1\\\n\\\nMultivariate Cox Regression Model for 60-Day Hospital Survival.\\\nINDEPENDENT VARIABLES AND OUTCOMES\\\nThe primary outcome (the dependent variable) was survival in the hospital at 60 days (Cox survival model). Data from patients who were discharged home before day 60 were censored at day 60, with the patients considered to be alive at day 60.\\\nThe independent variables tested as predictors included treatment group (lung-protective [i.e., varying variables such as VT, PEEP, and plateau pressures with an intention to protect] vs. control assignment), characteristics of patients, baseline severity of illness (e.g., risk according to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] or Simplified Acute Physiology Score [SAPS] and the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2:FiO2]), and ventilation variables (e.g., VT and plateau pressure) averaged over the first 24 hours after randomization (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In a separate analysis, we averaged individual ventilation data over the first 3 days and observed no predictive advantage of this approach (Tables S4, S5, and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients who received pressure-support ventilation or had respiratory rates that were higher than the ventilator settings (suggesting the presence of ventilatory efforts) were excluded. Both conditions accounted for less than 3% of our sample. Barotrauma was defined as pneumothorax requiring chest-tube drainage during the first 28 days after randomization.\\\nDERIVATION AND VALIDATION OF A SURVIVAL PREDICTION MODEL\\\nVariables that had a significant univariate association with survival were entered into a forward stepwise multivariate analysis and then into a backward stepwise multivariate analysis. Variables that were consistently found to be associated with survival with the use of both modeling procedures were included in the final derivation model. We adjusted all analyses for the trial variable (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The derivation model (model 1) was subsequently tested in each of the validation cohorts, as well as in the combined data set. To show that the prognostic information provided by \\uc0\\u916 P was independent of PEEP and plateau-pressure values, we resampled the combined data set (see Section III.3 in the Supplementary Appendix), producing subgroups of patients with matched mean levels for one variable (e.g., PEEP) but distinct mean levels for another ranking variable (e.g., driving pressure).\\\nMEDIATION ANALYSIS\\\nTo investigate whether \\uc0\\u916 P was more than a baseline risk predictor, we conducted a mediation analysis,24,25 searching for key variables that could be linked to positive outcomes after randomization. When mediation analysis is applied to randomized controlled trials, the goal is to determine whether a specific variable, strongly affected by treatment-group assignment, has an effect on outcomes that explains in whole or in part the effects resulting from treatment-group assignment.24,25 For the relevant fraction of the effect in which such a variable (the \\'93mediator\\'94 in the model) is implicated, the correlation with outcomes must exceed that of treatment group, typically exhibiting an independent, dose\\'96response relationship (i.e., larger mediator changes are associated with stronger survival effects). For example, in the lower-VT studies, we tested whether survival was better explained by specific ventilatory variables than by treatment group (the treatment group in these studies incorporated an intention-to-treat bundle including various recommendations, such as VT reduction, plateau-pressure limitation, and acidosis management). We tested four mediator candidates: VT, plateau pressure, PEEP, and \\u916 P. The first three variables were explicit targets in the protocols, whereas \\u916 P, which was a dependent variable in these studies, was the variable we hypothesized a priori to be the key mediator. Following standard procedures for mediation analysis, we examined each mediator candidate through a sequence of four logical tests, ultimately assessing whether variations in the mediator explained the mean benefit of the randomly assigned treatment group, as well as assessing the dose\\'96response effect on outcomes.\\\nWe used R software, version 2.10.1, with the R Package for Causal Mediation Analysis (R Project for Statistical Computing),23,24 in which a mediation proportion is estimated, indicating how much of the whole risk reduction in the treatment group can be explained by the indirect path in which treatment-group assignment drives a change in the mediator and the change in the mediator then affects the outcome (see the Supplementary Appendix). We calculated an average causal mediation effect,24 which expressed the independent hazard (relative risk) associated with this indirect path. Other analyses were conducted with the use of SPSS software, version 20 (SPSS).\\\nTo avoid possible biases due to differences in the severity of the underlying respiratory disorder\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARDS<|>EVENT<|>ARDS refers to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a severe lung condition that was the focus of the clinical trials mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>R Software is utilized for statistical computing and graphics, mentioned as being used for causal mediation analysis in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPSS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SPSS is a software platform used for statistical analysis, mentioned as being used for other analyses in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACUTE PHYSIOLOGY AND CHRONIC HEALTH EVALUATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) is a severity of disease classification system, mentioned as a baseline severity of illness measure in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMPLIFIED ACUTE PHYSIOLOGY SCORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) is another severity of disease classification system, mentioned alongside APACHE as a measure for baseline severity of illness)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARDS<|>R SOFTWARE<|>R Software was used for causal mediation analysis in the study of ARDS<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARDS<|>SPSS<|>SPSS was used for other analyses in the study of ARDS<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R SOFTWARE<|>SPSS<|>Both R Software and SPSS were used for statistical analysis in the ARDS study<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACUTE PHYSIOLOGY AND CHRONIC HEALTH EVALUATION<|>ARDS<|>APACHE score used as a measure for baseline severity of illness in ARDS patients<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMPLIFIED ACUTE PHYSIOLOGY SCORE<|>ARDS<|>SAPS used alongside APACHE as a measure for baseline severity of illness in ARDS patients<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
