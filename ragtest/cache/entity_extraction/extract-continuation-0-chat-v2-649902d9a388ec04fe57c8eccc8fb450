Patients were followed for 60 days or until death. The consumption of health care resources (indicated by the duration of vasopressor therapy and mechanical ventilation and the length of the hospital stay) was also examined.\nStatistical Analysis\nIn-hospital mortality was the primary efficacy end point. Secondary end points were the resuscitation end points, organ-dysfunction scores, coagulation-related variables, administered treatments, and the consumption of health care resources. Assuming a rate of refusal or exclusion of 10 percent, a two-sided type I error rate of 5 percent, and a power of 80 percent, we calculated that a sample size of 260 patients was required to permit the detection of a 15 percent reduction in in-hospital mortality. Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality, along with risk ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals, were used to describe the relative risk of death. Differences between the two groups at base line were tested with the use of Student's t-test, the chi-square test, or Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. Incremental analyses of the area under the curve were performed to quantify differences during the interval from base line to six hours after the start of treatment. For the data at six hours, analysis of covariance was used with the base-line values as the covariates. Mixed models were used to assess the effect of treatment on prespecified secondary variables during the interval from 7 to 72 hours after the start of treatment.27 An independent, 12-member external safety, efficacy, and data monitoring committee reviewed interim analyses of the data after one third and two thirds of the patients had been enrolled and at both times recommended that the trial be continued. To adjust for the two interim analyses, the alpha spending function of DeMets and Lan28 was used to determine that a P value of 0.04 or less would be considered to indicate statistical significance.\nResults\nBase-Line Characteristics\nWe evaluated 288 patients; 8.7 percent were excluded or did not consent to participate. The 263 patients enrolled were randomly assigned to undergo either standard therapy or early goal-directed therapy; 236 patients completed the initial six-hour study period. All 263 were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. The patients assigned to standard therapy stayed a significantly shorter time in the emergency department than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (mean [±SD], 6.3±3.2 vs. 8.0±2.1 hours; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the groups in any of the base-line characteristics, including the adequacy and duration of antibiotic therapy (Table 1). Vital signs, resuscitation end points, organ-dysfunction scores, and coagulation-related variables were also similar in the two study groups at base line (Table 2).\nTable 1\n\nBase-Line Characteristics of the Patients.\nTable 2\n\nVital Signs, Resuscitation End Points, Organ-Dysfunction Scores, and Coagulation Variables.\nTwenty-seven patients did not complete the initial six-hour study period (14 assigned to standard therapy and 13 assigned to early goal-directed therapy), for the following reasons: discontinuation of aggressive medical treatment (in 5 patients in each group), discontinuation of aggressive surgical treatment (in 2 patients in each group), a need for immediate surgery (in 4 patients assigned to standard therapy and in 3 assigned to early goal-directed therapy), a need for interventional urologic, cardiologic, or angiographic procedures (in 2 patients in each group), and refusal to continue participation (in 1 patient in each group) (P=0.99 for all comparisons). There were no significant differences between the patients who completed the initial six-hour study period and those who did not in any of the base-line characteristics or base-line vital signs, resuscitation end points, organ-dysfunction scores, or coagulation-related variables (data not shown).\nVital Signs and Resuscitation End Points\nDuring the initial six hours after the start of therapy, there was no significant difference between the two study groups in the mean heart rate (P=0.25) or central venous pressure (P=0.22) (Table 2). During this period, the mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the group assigned to standard therapy than in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P<0.001), but in both groups the goal of 65 mm Hg or higher was met by all the patients. The goal of 70 percent or higher for central venous oxygen saturation was met by 60.2 percent of the patients in the standard-therapy group, as compared with 94.9 percent of those in the early-therapy group (P<0.001). The combined hemodynamic goals for central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and urine output (with adjustment for patients with end-stage renal failure) were achieved in 86.1 percent of the standard-therapy group, as compared with 99.2 percent of the early-therapy group (P<0.001). During this period, the patients assigned to standard therapy had a significantly lower central venous oxygen saturation (P<0.001) and a greater base deficit (P=0.006) than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy; the two groups\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MULTIPLE ORGAN DYSFUNCTION SCORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A scale from 0 to 24 used to indicate the severity of organ dysfunction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STUDENT'S T-TEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A statistical test used to compare the means of two groups)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHI-SQUARE TEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A statistical test used to compare observed results with expected results)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILCOXON'S RANK-SUM TEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A nonparametric statistical test used to compare two samples)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEMET'S AND LAN<|>PERSON<|>Developers of the alpha spending function used in statistical analysis to adjust for interim analyses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EARLY GOAL-DIRECTED THERAPY<|>EVENT<|>A therapeutic approach for managing patients, evaluated in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD THERAPY<|>EVENT<|>The conventional treatment approach against which early goal-directed therapy was compared)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EARLY GOAL-DIRECTED THERAPY<|>STANDARD THERAPY<|>Early goal-directed therapy was compared to standard therapy in the study to evaluate its effectiveness<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEMET'S AND LAN<|>STUDENT'S T-TEST<|>DeMets and Lan's alpha spending function is used alongside statistical tests like Student's T-test for interim analysis adjustments<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEMET'S AND LAN<|>CHI-SQUARE TEST<|>DeMets and Lan's methodology potentially applies to adjustments in analyses involving the Chi-square test<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEMET'S AND LAN<|>WILCOXON'S RANK-SUM TEST<|>The alpha spending function by DeMets and Lan could be used to adjust significance levels in analyses involving Wilcoxon's Rank-Sum Test<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
