We calculated an average causal mediation effect,24 which expressed the independent hazard (relative risk) associated with this indirect path. Other analyses were conducted with the use of SPSS software, version 20 (SPSS).\\\nTo avoid possible biases due to differences in the severity of the underlying respiratory disorder, we preadjusted all mediation models according to the baseline respiratory system tidal elastance (the reciprocal of tidal compliance). For the lower-VT trials, this calculation was not possible, because baseline data were frequently missing. Thus, we used the elastance ranks within each treatment group (calculated after randomization) for each trial, assuming that the systematic changes in ventilation parameters due to treatment-group assignment might affect absolute values of elastance but would not affect the ranking of individual elastance values within the respective study groups. In the Supplementary Appendix (Section II.4, Fig. S3), we present a sensitivity analysis addressing this assumption.\\\nIn addition to the covariates of model 1, we entered baseline respiratory system tidal elastance in all regression models used for the mediation analysis, a procedure that intrinsically filtered out the potential confounding caused by differences in the severity of underlying lung disease. Accordingly, the mediation analysis exclusively addressed the effect of variations in \\uc0\\u8710 P related to strategy \\'97 that is, variations in \\u8710 P superimposed by changes in ventilator settings after randomization.\\\nResults\\\nBUILDING AND TESTING THE PREDICTION MODEL\\\nIn univariate analyses in the derivation cohort, several significant associations were detected between independent predictor variables and survival (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Two baseline variables (risk according to APACHE or SAPS and arterial pH) and two ventilator variables (FiO2 and \\uc0\\u916 P) were significantly associated with survival after multivariate adjustment.\\\nThe test of this preliminary model in our first validation cohort showed that baseline PaO2:FiO2 could replace the information associated with the FiO2 variable (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix), with the advantage of being externally validated.26 We also observed that age was a strong, independent predictor of survival even though it is a component of the APACHE score. After conservatively including the trial covariate, our final model included six variables (Table 1, model 1); in this model, \\uc0\\u916 P predicted survival as accurately as did risk according to APACHE or SAPS.\\\nTreatment-group assignment was not independently associated with survival in model 1 and was omitted from Table 1. This variable was considered separately in our mediation analysis. Testing of model 1 in the second validation cohort showed a strong association with survival (P<0.001), with all covariates conferring similar relative risks in the two cohorts.\\\nINDEPENDENCE OF INFORMATION\\\nEven though \\uc0\\u916 P is mathematically linked to CRS and VT, no other ventilation variable conferred independent predictive information to any survival model when \\u916 P was already a covariate. In contrast, \\u916 P always conferred strong, nonredundant predictive information when it was included in models preadjusted for other ventilator variables (Table 1, models 2 and 3; and Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix, models 2 through 5). This observation was consistent in the derivation, validation, and combined cohorts. Higher \\u916 P predicted lower survival consistently across trials (P=0.13 for heterogeneity) (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\\\nRISK PRIORITY OF \\uc0\\u916 P\\\nFigure 1 shows that in the pooled sample (including 3562 patients), higher plateau pressures were observed in patients with higher \\uc0\\u916 P or higher PEEP, but with different consequences (resampling A vs. B): higher mortality was noted only when higher plateau pressures were observed in patients with higher \\u916 Ps. Similarly, the protective effects of higher PEEP were noted only when there were associated decreases in \\u916 P (resampling B vs. C). In addition, at constant levels of plateau pressure (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix), we observed that VT was a strong predictor of survival when normalized to CRS (i.e., \\u916 P) but not when normalized to predicted body weight.\\\nFIGURE 1\\\n\\\nRelative Risk of Death in the Hospital across Relevant Subsamples after Multivariate Adjustment \\'97 Survival Effect of Ventilation Pressures.\\\nWe also found a strong association between \\uc0\\u916 P and survival even though all the ventilator settings that were used were lung-protective (relative risk of death, 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17 to 1.58; P<0.001).2,11 In contrast, further reductions in plateau pressures or VT below these thresholds (plateau pressures \\u8804 30 cm of water and VT \\u8804 7 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight) had no effect on survival (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\\\nFigure 2 shows the increase in the risk of death as a function of progressive percentiles of \\uc0\\u916 P in the combined population. There was also an increase in the odds of pneumothorax requiring drainage as a function of progressive percentiles of \\u916 P but not of VT (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\\\nFIGURE 2\\\n\\\nRelative Risk of Death in the Hospital versus \\uc0\\u916 P in the Combined Cohort after Multivariate Adjustment.\\\nTEST OF MEDIATION\\\nAfter observing that \\uc0\\u916\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPSS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SPSS is a software used for statistical analysis, mentioned in the context of conducting other analyses for a study on the effects of treatment-group assignment on outcomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APACHE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>APACHE refers to a scoring system used to predict mortality risk in patients, mentioned as a baseline variable significantly associated with survival after multivariate adjustment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAPS refers to a scoring system used to predict mortality risk in patients, mentioned alongside APACHE as a baseline variable significantly associated with survival)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FI02<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FiO2, though not an organization, is mentioned as a ventilator variable significantly associated with survival, indicating its importance in the study's analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELTA P (ΔP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Delta P (ΔP), though not an organization, is highlighted as a key ventilator variable that predicted survival accurately, showing its critical role in the study's findings)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
