First, hydrocortisone in septic shock showed conflicting results in terms of mortality, but consistent hemodynamic effects and faster septic shock resolution.6,24 Second, administration of hydrocortisone was associated with immunomodulatory effects including reduced inducible nitric oxide formation—a key mediator of septic shock pathophysiology.17 Thus, it was hypothesized that attenuation of inflammation in early severe sepsis could prevent progression to shock. Third, this hypothesis was supported by data of Confalonieri et al8 showing that septic shock was prevented by hydrocortisone in patients with CAP. Fourth, because occurrence of septic shock is associated with an increased risk of mortality,28 it was hypothesized that prevention of septic shock leading to organ dysfunction could also affect secondary outcome variables such as LOS in the ICU or mortality. If prolonged administration of hydrocortisone was able to prevent septic shock development, this beneficial effect of hydrocortisone could outweigh adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, which can be readily treated by administration of insulin. Vasopressor-dependent (volume-resistant) septic shock in patients with sepsis is still the key indication for suggesting hydrocortisone in the current international guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.2 Hence, it seems plausible to take this as a primary end point if prevention of septic shock is tested. We assumed a rate of septic shock of 40% in patients with severe sepsis based on previous studies8,25-27 and data from the SepNet Clinical Trials Group. However, owing to different study populations, effect sizes, and septic shock criteria, only a rough estimation was possible (see limitations described later). According to recommendations of the German Sepsis Society to transfer patients with severe sepsis to an intermediate care unit or ICU, only patients treated in these units were enrolled in HYPRESS. This was different from a recent retrospective cohort study of patients with sepsis and similar lactate values but lower hospital mortality (7.9% mortality in the study by Liu et al29 vs 13.1% mortality in this study), who were treated predominantly in the general ward.29\n\nHowever, the current study did not show a protective effect on shock development, time to septic shock, mortality, or LOS in the ICU or hospital. The results are in contrast to a small study in 46 patients with severe CAP, in which hydrocortisone administration was associated with improved survival and significantly lower rates of septic shock. This study was prematurely stopped after an interim analysis owing to improvement of oxygenation and hospital mortality.8 The presented data did not support that hydrocortisone was more effective with regard to the primary or secondary end points in patients with pneumonia or in the subgroup of patients with CAP. However, recent larger RCTs of steroids in patients with CAP did not reveal reduction of mortality but did show some beneficial effects on other outcomes. In 304 non-ICU patients, a 4-day treatment with 5 mg of dexamethasone reduced median hospital LOS by 1 day.30 Another RCT enrolled 120 patients with severe CAP and a high inflammatory response who received methylprednisolone at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg twice daily or placebo for 5 days.10 Primary end points were parameters of early (<72 hours) or late (72-120 hours) treatment failure. Treatment failure rates were lower in patients who received steroids than in those who received placebo (13% vs 32%, respectively; P = .02), with late radiographic progression as the only significantly different parameter; notably, late septic shock was rare and less frequent in patients who received steroids than in those who received placebo (0 vs 4 patients, respectively). In the largest RCT to date, with 785 patients with CAP, patients received either 50 mg of prednisone or placebo for 7 days.9 The primary end point was time to clinical stability for at least 24 hours. Treatment with prednisone shortened time to clinical stability by 1 to 4 days irrespective of severity of CAP, and it shortened time to hospital discharge and duration of antibiotic therapy by 1 day. Thus, there is some evidence that moderate doses of steroids may be more effective in patients with CAP than other causes of sepsis.11\n\nAnother interesting finding in this study was that despite a higher risk of septic shock in patients with CIRCI, there was no detectable difference in septic shock development between treatment groups; however, sample size and event numbers were small. The results are in line with results of the CORTICUS trial, in which effects of hydrocortisone on septic shock resolution were independent from CIRCI. Moreover, in a CORTICUS subgroup analysis, etomidate administration was associated with a significantly higher risk for CIRCI and 28-day mortality. However, hydrocortisone treatment did not reduce mortality in patients with CIRCI who received etomidate.31 Whether combined biomarkers may be more suitable to detect eligible patients needs further investigation. A subgroup analysis of patients with CAP showed most effects in patients who had low basal cortisol levels combined with high proinflammatory cytokine profiles.32\n\nThe results from this study do not support an increased risk for secondary infections. Reasonable concerns were amplified by results of the CORTICUS trial, which showed higher numbers of secondary infections including new sepsis and septic shock in patients who received hydrocortisone.4 A Bayesian analysis, mainly based on CORT\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>Septic shock is a severe and potentially fatal condition that occurs as a complication of an infection where the body's response to the infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure which can lead to organ failure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hydrocortisone is a medication used in the treatment of septic shock for its hemodynamic effects and potential to speed up septic shock resolution, despite conflicting results regarding its impact on mortality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An international initiative aimed at reducing mortality from sepsis and septic shock, which provides guidelines for the treatment of sepsis, including the use of hydrocortisone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPNET CLINICAL TRIALS GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A research consortium focused on studying sepsis and its treatments, which has contributed data on septic shock rates among patients with severe sepsis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMAN SEPSIS SOCIETY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A professional organization dedicated to the study and treatment of sepsis, recommending the transfer of patients with severe sepsis to specialized care units)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYPRESS<|>EVENT<|>A study or trial investigating the effects of hydrocortisone on septic shock development, mortality, and length of stay in ICU or hospital among patients with severe sepsis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORTICUS TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>A clinical trial that explored the effects of hydrocortisone on septic shock resolution and its association with CIRCI and mortality, including the impact of etomidate administration)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>Hydrocortisone is used in the treatment of septic shock for its potential benefits on hemodynamic stability and shock resolution<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest hydrocortisone as a treatment option for septic shock<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEPNET CLINICAL TRIALS GROUP<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>The SepNet Clinical Trials Group provides data on septic shock rates, contributing to the understanding and treatment guidelines of septic shock<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERMAN SEPSIS SOCIETY<|>HYPRESS<|>The German Sepsis Society's recommendations influenced the design of the HYPRESS study, particularly the enrollment of patients treated in intermediate care units or ICUs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORTICUS TRIAL<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>The CORTICUS trial investigated the effects of hydrocortisone on septic shock and its outcomes, influencing subsequent research and treatment approaches<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
