Rivers et al. reported nearly perfect adherence but did not provide details regarding the assessment method. Although adherence to the protocol was high in our study, we cannot exclude the possibility that the outcome would have been better if adherence had been perfect. We believe that the rate of adherence in our study parallels the likely performance in any widespread effort targeting the care of patients with septic shock. Furthermore, changes during the past decade in the care of critically ill patients, including the use of lower hemoglobin levels as a threshold for transfusion, the implementation of lung-protection strategies, and the use of tighter control of blood sugar, may have helped lower the overall mortality and may have reduced the marginal benefit of alternative resuscitation strategies.9,10,16,17\nIn 2010, Jones et al. reported the results of a randomized trial involving a patient population similar to ours (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). That trial showed that an EGDT protocol that was based on serial measurement of serum lactate levels was not inferior to an EGDT protocol that used ScvO2 monitoring.14 In-hospital mortality and the use of intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, and dobutamine were similar to those seen in the ProCESS trial. Other studies showing the benefit of EGDT in adults presenting to the emergency department with septic shock have been observational and open to potential confounding.18\nThere are important limitations to our study. First, although we took many steps to ensure close adherence to the resuscitation protocols, we cannot be sure that elements critical to the success of the protocol in the study by Rivers et al. were not lost during dissemination. Second, we enrolled patients who were recognized to be in septic shock. Our study does not address the extent to which any of these strategies offer advantages in settings where septic shock is not recognized promptly. Third, septic shock occurs in a heterogeneous population, and care before randomization can be variable. Fourth, we had limited power to address whether particular strategies were more effective in specific subgroups. Two ongoing multicenter trials of EGDT, the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) trial in Australia (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975793) and the Protocolised Management in Sepsis (ProMISe) trial in the United Kingdom (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN36307479) may offer additional insight.19,20 Finally, in-hospital mortality among patients requiring life support is strongly influenced by varying practices regarding the withdrawal of care, which could have influenced our findings.\nIn summary, in our multicenter, randomized trial, in which patients were identified early in the emergency department as having septic shock and received antibiotics and other nonresuscitation aspects of care promptly, we found no significant advantage, with respect to mortality or morbidity, of protocol-based resuscitation over bedside care that was provided according to the treating physician's judgment. We also found no significant benefit of the mandated use of central venous catheterization and central hemodynamic monitoring in all patients.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EGDT PROTOCOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A protocol used in both trials for managing patients with septic shock, involving a dedicated team and specific treatment strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIVERS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who reported nearly perfect adherence to the EGDT protocol in their study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JONES ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who reported a randomized trial comparing EGDT protocols based on serum lactate levels and ScvO2 monitoring)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>A trial that compared the effectiveness of EGDT protocols in managing septic shock and found similar outcomes in hospital mortality and treatment methods used)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARISE TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>A multicenter trial in Australia evaluating EGDT in sepsis management, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with number NCT00975793)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROMISE TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>A trial in the United Kingdom evaluating protocolised management in sepsis, registered at Current Controlled Trials with number ISRCTN36307479)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT PROTOCOL<|>RIVERS ET AL.<|>Rivers et al. reported nearly perfect adherence to the EGDT protocol in their study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT PROTOCOL<|>JONES ET AL.<|>Jones et al. conducted a randomized trial involving an EGDT protocol<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGDT PROTOCOL<|>PROCESS TRIAL<|>The ProCESS trial evaluated the effectiveness of EGDT protocols in septic shock management<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARISE TRIAL<|>EGDT PROTOCOL<|>The ARISE trial is evaluating the effectiveness of EGDT in sepsis management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROMISE TRIAL<|>EGDT PROTOCOL<|>The ProMISe trial is evaluating protocolised management in sepsis, which may involve EGDT<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
