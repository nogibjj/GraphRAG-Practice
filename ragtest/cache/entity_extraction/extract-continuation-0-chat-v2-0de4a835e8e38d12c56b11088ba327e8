The writing committee vouches for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol.\nSites and Patients\nAll the participating sites were academic hospitals with more than 40,000 emergency department visits yearly. To be eligible, the study sites had to use the measurement of serum lactate levels as the method for screening for cryptogenic shock and had to adhere to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines9,10 for nonresuscitation aspects of care but could have no routine resuscitation protocols for septic shock and could not routinely use continuous ScvO2 catheters. We recruited patients in the emergency department in whom sepsis was suspected according to the treating physician, who were at least 18 years of age, who met two or more criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome11 (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix), and who had refractory hypotension or a serum lactate level of 4 mmol per liter or higher. We defined refractory hypotension as a systolic blood pressure that either was less than 90 mm Hg or required vasopressor therapy to maintain 90 mm Hg even after an intravenous fluid challenge. We initially required the fluid challenge to be 20 ml or more per kilogram of body weight, administered over the course of 30 minutes, but in April 2010, we simplified the requirement to a challenge of 1000 ml or more administered over the course of 30 minutes. Patients did not have to be in shock on arrival in the emergency department but had to be enrolled in the study in the emergency department within 2 hours after the earliest detection of shock and within 12 hours after arrival. The exclusion criteria are listed in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix. All patients or their legally authorized representatives provided written informed consent. Randomization was performed with the use of a centralized Web-based program in variable block sizes of 3, 6, or 9, with stratification according to site and race.\nStudy Interventions\nWe randomly assigned patients, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to one of three groups: protocol-based EGDT, protocol-based standard therapy, or usual care. The same trained and dedicated physician-led team implemented both the protocol-based EGDT and the protocol-based standard-therapy interventions. The team consisted of at least one available physician who was trained in the protocol-guided resuscitation interventions, a study coordinator who monitored adherence to protocol instructions and provided timed prompts, and a bedside nurse. All study physicians were trained in emergency medicine or critical care medicine and had completed a Web-based certification examination. The protocol-based care began in the emergency department but could be continued elsewhere. Details regarding the training and conduct of the personnel are provided in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix. In cases in which a team physician was the bedside provider before enrollment, care was transferred to a nonstudy physician before enrollment.\nFor patients randomly assigned to protocol-based EGDT, the resuscitation team followed the protocol outlined in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, which mimics that used by Rivers et al.4 The protocol prompted placement of a central venous catheter to monitor pressure and ScvO2 and to administer intravenous fluids, vasopressors, dobutamine, or packed red-cell transfusions, as directed. We did not require placement of an arterial catheter for blood-pressure monitoring. The protocol in our study, like the protocol in the study by Rivers et al., specified the amount and timing, but not the type, of resuscitation fluid. Similarly, the protocol in our study specified thresholds for vasopressor use but not the specific choice of vasopressor. The protocol guided only resuscitation, with all other aspects of care, including the choice of antimicrobial agents, given at the discretion of the treating physician.\nProtocol-based standard therapy also used a team approach with a set of 6-hour resuscitation instructions, but the components were less aggressive than those used for protocol-based EGDT (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). ProCESS investigators designed the protocol-based standard-therapy approach on the basis of a review of the literature, two independent surveys of emergency physician and intensivist practice worldwide,5,12 and consensus feedback from investigators. Protocol-based standard therapy required adequate peripheral venous access (with placement of a central venous catheter only if peripheral access was insufficient) and administration of fluids and vasoactive agents to reach goals for systolic blood pressure and shock index (the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure) and to address fluid status and hypoperfusion, which were assessed clinically at least once an hour. In contrast to the triggers in the EGDT protocol, protocol-based standard therapy recommended packed red-cell transfusion only if the hemoglobin level was less than 7.5 g per deciliter. The protocol for standard therapy mandated administration of fluids until the team leader decided that the patient's fluids were replete. The standard-therapy protocol, like the EGDT protocol, did not specify the type of fluid or vasopressor and did not specify nonresuscitation aspects of care, which were provided by the treating physician. We assessed adherence to the EGDT and standard-therapy protocols using an algorithm that screened for decision prompts and actions at 2, 4, and 6 hours (Fig. S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFor patients in the usual-care group, the bedside providers directed all care, with the study coordinator collecting data but not prompting any actions. Lead investigators at a site could not serve as the bedside treating physician for patients in the usual-care group.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary outcome of the study was the rate of in-hospital death from any\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMIC HOSPITALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hospitals with more than 40,000 emergency department visits yearly, participating in a study on sepsis treatment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set of guidelines for nonresuscitation aspects of care for septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTOCOL-BASED EGDT<|>EVENT<|>A treatment group in the study following a specific protocol for early goal-directed therapy in sepsis treatment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTOCOL-BASED STANDARD THERAPY<|>EVENT<|>A treatment group in the study following a standard therapy protocol for sepsis treatment, less aggressive than EGDT)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USUAL CARE<|>EVENT<|>A control group in the study where patients received standard care without specific protocol interventions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEB-BASED CERTIFICATION EXAMINATION<|>EVENT<|>An examination that all study physicians completed to be trained in protocol-guided resuscitation interventions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACADEMIC HOSPITALS<|>SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN<|>Academic hospitals had to adhere to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines to be eligible for the study<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROTOCOL-BASED EGDT<|>PROTOCOL-BASED STANDARD THERAPY<|>Both are treatment protocols used in the study, with EGDT being more aggressive<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROTOCOL-BASED STANDARD THERAPY<|>USUAL CARE<|>Standard therapy and usual care represent different levels of intervention in the study, with usual care not following a specific protocol<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROTOCOL-BASED EGDT<|>WEB-BASED CERTIFICATION EXAMINATION<|>Physicians implementing EGDT had to complete a web-based certification examination<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
