Therefore, we may not have detected differences in the incidence of some adverse events, especially rare events such as myocardial infarction.\nSeptic shock is a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation,17 and in our study, atrial fibrillation was significantly more common in the high-target group than in the low-target group. This adverse effect might be related to the significantly higher doses of catecholamine and the longer duration of catecholamine infusions in the high-target group. However, given the small number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, other confounding factors cannot be ruled out. The association between atrial fibrillation and septic shock should be considered only as a hypothesis-generating concept for future trials.\nAt randomization, patients were stratified according of the presence or absence of chronic hypertension. More than 40% of the patients reported having a history of chronic hypertension, which is in line with rates in previous studies.18 Among patients with chronic hypertension, a rightward shift of the curve for organ pressure-flow autoregulation is expected, which means that an increased mean arterial pressure could hypothetically result in improved organ perfusion11 and, eventually, in improved survival rates. No significant differences in adverse effects between patients with chronic hypertension and those without chronic hypertension were evident. The results in the subgroup with chronic hypertension may indicate that targeting a higher mean arterial pressure is acceptable because it was not associated with greater harms.\nThe guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommend targeting a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg. According to our study design, investigators were invited to follow these guidelines in the low-target group. However, the observed mean arterial pressures in the low-target group (target range, 65 to 70 mm Hg) were for the most part between 70 and 75 mm Hg. Similarly, the observed values in the high-target group were also higher (between 85 and 90 mm Hg) than the predefined target range of 80 to 85 mm Hg. Thus, the target between-group difference was well maintained. Whether higher achieved mean arterial pressures in the two groups influenced the results is impossible to ascertain. However, given the pragmatic nature of the trial, these data were not recorded as protocol violations. In addition, the higher mean arterial pressures in the two groups may reflect the reluctance of some attending physicians to decrease the vasopressor infusion rate when the mean arterial pressure is about 70 mm Hg, as recently reported by Poukkanen et al.19 In that study, patients spent more than 75% of the time at a mean arterial pressure of more than 70 mm Hg. Finally, the generalizability of our trial results may be limited because of the frequent use of glucocorticoids and activated protein C and because of the large number of patients who were excluded because of the narrow inclusion window.\nIn conclusion, among patients with septic shock, 28-day and 90-day mortality did not differ significantly between those who were treated to reach a target mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg and those who were treated to reach a target of 65 to 70 mm Hg.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
