We hypothesized that low-dose vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine would decrease mortality among patients with septic shock who were being treated with conventional (catecholamine) vasopressors.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned patients who had septic shock and were receiving a minimum of 5 μg of norepinephrine per minute to receive either low-dose vasopressin (0.01 to 0.03 U per minute) or norepinephrine (5 to 15 μg per minute) in addition to open-label vasopressors. All vasopressor infusions were titrated and tapered according to protocols to maintain a target blood pressure. The primary end point was the mortality rate 28 days after the start of infusions.\nResults\nA total of 778 patients underwent randomization, were infused with the study drug (396 patients received vasopressin, and 382 norepinephrine), and were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in the 28-day mortality rate (35.4% and 39.3%, respectively; P=0.26) or in 90-day mortality (43.9% and 49.6%, respectively; P=0.11). There were no significant differences in the overall rates of serious adverse events (10.3% and 10.5%, respectively; P=1.00). In the prospectively defined stratum of less severe septic shock, the mortality rate was lower in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group at 28 days (26.5% vs. 35.7%, P=0.05); in the stratum of more severe septic shock, there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality (44.0% and 42.5%, respectively; P=0.76). A test for heterogeneity between these two study strata was not significant (P=0.10).\nConclusions\nLow-dose vasopressin did not reduce mortality rates as compared with norepinephrine among patients with septic shock who were treated with catecholamine vasopressors. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN94845869.)\nSeptic shock is the most common cause of death in intensive care units (ICUs)1,2 and has a mortality rate of 40 to 60%. 2,3 Resuscitation strategies include the administration of intravenous fluids and the use of catecholamines such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and dobutamine.4,5 Although largely effective in reestablishing minimally acceptable mean arterial pressures to maintain organ perfusion, catecholamines have important adverse effects and may even increase mortality rates.6 For example, norepinephrine, a potent and commonly used α-adrenergic agent in cases of septic shock, may decrease cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and blood flow to vulnerable organs despite adequate perfusion pressure.7\nVasopressin, an endogenously released peptide hormone, has emerged as an adjunct to catecholamines for patients who have severe septic shock. The rationale for its use is the relative vasopressin deficiency in patients with septic shock and the hypothesis that exogenously administered vasopressin can restore vascular tone and blood pressure, thereby reducing the need for the use of catecholamines.8–10 Observational studies involving the use of vasopressin infusion rates below 0.1 U per minute in patients with vasodilatory shock have repeatedly shown improved short-term blood-pressure responses.10–14 However, vasopressin infusion may decrease blood flow in the heart, kidneys, and intestine. Despite the widespread use of vasopressin in clinical practice, only two small randomized trials have evaluated its use in patients who had septic shock.10,12 Vasopressin increased blood pressure, decreased catecholamine requirements, and improved renal function as compared with a control agent. However, neither of the trials was powered to evaluate mortality, organ dysfunction, or safety.\nTo address these uncertainties, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind trial among patients who had septic shock and were receiving usual care (including catecholamines), to determine whether vasopressin decreased 28-day mortality, as compared with norepinephrine. Our secondary hypothesis was that the beneficial effects of vasopressin would be more pronounced than those of norepinephrine in the subgroup of patients with more severe (as opposed to less severe) septic shock. Therefore, we stratified patients at the time of randomization according to the baseline dose of norepinephrine.\nMethods\nThis trial was conducted between July 2001 and April 2006 in 27 centers in Canada, Australia, and the United States and was approved by the research ethics boards of all participating institutions. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, their next of kin, or another surrogate decision maker, as appropriate. The data were collected by the investigators and analyzed by the data management committee. The executive committee vouches for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analysis.
