Among the 299 remaining patients, there were 229 nonresponders (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36).\n\nCharacteristics of Study Patients at Inclusion\nAt baseline, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to general characteristics (Table 1) and severity of illness (Table 2). Cortisol response to corticotropin was higher in the corticosteroid group than in the placebo group in the all-patients analysis, but the distribution of patients according to our 3-level prognostic classification8 was similar in the 2 groups. The type and site of infection and the type of organism involved were also similar in the 2 groups (Table 3). Finally, a blinded evaluation determined that appropriate antibiotic therapy, based on the site of infection and available cultures, was promptly (<24 hours from diagnosis of severe sepsis) started and continued for at least 7 days in most cases (ie, 95% in the placebo group, 91% in the corticosteroid group).\n\nMortality Distribution\nNonresponders\nAt day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 12 days in the placebo group and 24 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.95; P = .02; Figure 2A). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 7 (95% CI, 4-49).\n\nResponders\nAt day 28, there were 18 deaths (53%) in the placebo group and 22 deaths (61%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 14 days in the placebo group and 16.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of survival distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .81) (Figure 2B).\n\nAll Patients\nAt day 28, there were 91 deaths (61%) in the placebo group and 82 deaths (55%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 13 days in the placebo group and 19.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.97; P = .03) (Figure 2C). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 8 (95% CI, 5-81).\n\nMortality Rates\nNonresponders\nAs mentioned above, at day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = .04). There were 81 deaths (70%) in the placebo group and 66 deaths (58%) in the corticosteroid group at the end of ICU stay (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00; adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89; P = .02). A similar significant difference was observed at the end of hospital stay. There were 88 deaths (77%) in the placebo group and 77 deaths (68%) in the corticosteroid group after 1 year of follow-up (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31-1.04; P = .07) (Table 4).\n\nResponders\nThere was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in responders (Table 4).\n\nAll Patients\nThere was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in all patients. For example, the ICU mortality is represented by RR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.75-1.05), adjusted OR, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.02), P = .06 and year of follow-up is represented by RR, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.78-1.04), adjusted OR, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.36-1.05), P = .08 (Table 4).\n\nTime-to-Vasopressor-Therapy Withdrawal\nNonresponders\nThe median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 10 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.29-2.84; P = .001) (Figure 3A). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group.\n\nResponders\nThe median time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal was 7 days in the placebo group\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients receiving placebo treatment in a clinical study, compared against those receiving corticosteroids for various outcomes including mortality rates and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORTICOSTEROID GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients receiving corticosteroid treatment in a clinical study, showing different outcomes in mortality rates and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal compared to the placebo group)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>CORTICOSTEROID GROUP<|>The placebo group and corticosteroid group were compared in a clinical study to assess the effects of corticosteroids on mortality rates and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
