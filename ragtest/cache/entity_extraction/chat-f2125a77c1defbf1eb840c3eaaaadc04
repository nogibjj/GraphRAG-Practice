In the per-protocol populations, we excluded patients who had one or more bleeding or ischemic episodes or one or more major protocol violations (see the Supplementary Appendix).22\nIn the primary analyses (including the analysis of the primary outcome measure), we compared data between the two groups by means of logistic-regression analysis for binary outcome measures with adjustment for the stratification variables (study site and presence or absence of active hematologic cancer),23 and we converted odds ratios to relative risks.24 We also performed unadjusted chi-square testing for binary outcome measures and Wilcoxon signed-rank testing for rate and ordinal data. We compared the primary outcome in the per-protocol populations and in prespecified subgroups defined according to the presence or absence of chronic cardiovascular disease (i.e., any history of myocardial infarction, any history of stable or unstable angina pectoris, previous treatment with nitrates, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary-artery bypass grafting or noncoronary vascular interventions, any history of chronic heart failure [defined as New York Heart Association class III or IV], or any history of cerebral infarction or transitory cerebral ischemia), an age of 70 years or younger versus an age older than 70 years, and a Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II above 53 versus 53 or lower at baseline (with the score calculated from 17 variables and ranging from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating higher severity of disease) and used multiple logistic-regression analyses in the intention-to-treat population to adjust for differences in prespecified risk factors at baseline. Details regarding the handling of missing data are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. We performed all analyses using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Software), and SPSS software, version 17.0 (SPSS). A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nResults\nTrial Population\nWe obtained 90-day vital status for 998 patients (99.3%), including 502 in the lower-threshold group and 496 in the higher-threshold group (Figure 1). The characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 29 of 488 patients (5.9%) in the lower-threshold group and 11 of 489 (2.2%) in the higher-threshold group had the protocol temporarily suspended (P=0.004) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Trial Patients at Baseline.\nHemoglobin Concentrations, Blood Products, and Circulatory Variables\nThe median value of the lowest concentration of hemoglobin in the 24 hours before randomization was 8.4 g per deciliter in both intervention groups. After randomization, the daily lowest concentrations of hemoglobin differed between the two groups (P<0.001) (Figure 2). Additional details regarding hemoglobin assessments are provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nFigure 2\n\nBlood Hemoglobin Levels in Patients in the ICU at Baseline and after Randomization.\nDuring the trial period, a total of 1545 blood transfusions were given in the lower-threshold group and 3088 transfusions in the higher-threshold group (P<0.001). The median cumulative number of blood transfusions after randomization was 1 unit (interquartile range, 0 to 3) in the lower-threshold group and 4 (interquartile range, 2 to 7) in the higher-threshold group (P<0.001). A total of 176 patients (36.1%) in the lower-threshold group did not undergo transfusion in the ICU, as compared with 6 (1.2%) in the higher-threshold group (P<0.001). Details regarding blood products, bleeding, cointerventions, fluid volumes and balances, and circulatory assessments are provided in Tables S4 through S9 in the Supplementary Appendix. The numbers of protocol violations differed significantly between the two groups (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nOutcomes\nAt 90 days after randomization, 216 patients (43.0%) in the lower-threshold group and 223 (45.0%) in the higher-threshold group had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.09; P=0.44) (Table 2 and Figure 3, and Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). We obtained similar results in the analyses that were adjusted for prespecified baseline risk factors and in the per-protocol analyses (Table S12 in the Supplementary Appendix). The prespecified subgroup analyses showed no significant heterogeneity in the effect of the transfusion threshold on mortality at 90 days between patients with and those without chronic cardiovascular disease, patients 70 years of age or younger and those older than 70 years of age, and patients with a SAPS II of 53 or less and those with a SAPS II of more than 53 at baseline (Figure 3).\nFigure 3\n\nTime to Death and Relative Risk of Death at 90 Days.\nTable 2\n\nPrimary and Secondary Outcome Measures.\nA total of 7.2% of the patients in the lower-threshold group, as compared with 8.0% in the higher-threshold group, had one or more ischemic events in the ICU (Table 2, and Tables S13 and S14 in the Supplementary Appendix, which include the numbers of patients with myocardial ischemia and ischem\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
