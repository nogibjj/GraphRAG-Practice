Patients, research staff members, and members of the safety and writing committees were unaware of the study-group assignments.\nStudy Oversight\nThe data and safety monitoring committee oversaw the trial conduct and the safety of the patients, with interim analyses performed after the inclusion of 200, 400, and 600 patients. Data were collected by the investigators and analyzed by the data-management committee. The steering committee vouches for the accuracy of the data, the completeness of the analysis, and the fidelity of the study to the protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Members of the steering committee made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The writing committee (the first author and the last three authors) had full access to all the data and collaborated with all the investigators in the writing of the manuscript. All the drugs used in the study were purchased from the manufacturers, which had no role in the study.\nStudy Patients\nPatients older than 18 years of age were enrolled if they had septic shock that was refractory to fluid resuscitation, if they required vasopressors (norepinephrine or epinephrine) at a minimum infusion rate of 0.1 μg per kilogram per minute, and if they were evaluated within 6 hours after the initiation of vasopressors. Refractoriness to fluid resuscitation was defined as a lack of response to the administration of 30 ml of normal saline per kilogram of body weight or of colloids or was determined according to a clinician's assessment of inadequate hemodynamic results on the basis of values obtained during right-heart catheterization, pulse-pressure measurement, stroke-volume measurement, or echocardiography (although study investigators did not record the values for these variables). Septic shock was defined by the presence of two or more diagnostic criteria of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, proven or suspected infection, and sudden dysfunction of at least one organ.12 Exclusion criteria were legal protection (i.e., incompetence to provide consent and no guardian or incarceration), no affiliation with the French health care system, pregnancy, recent participation in another biomedical study or another interventional study with mortality as the primary end point, or an investigator's decision not to resuscitate.\nStudy Treatments\nFluid resuscitation was performed as recommended by the French intensive care societies,13 with norepinephrine administered as a first-line vasopressor, except at one center, in which epinephrine was used. The use of activated protein C and hydrocortisone was left to the discretion of the attending physician, and the following treatments were prohibited: the use of diuretics, except for compelling indications, such as hypoxemia attributed to symptomatic sodium and water overload or life-threatening hyperkalemia; the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; the use of iodinated contrast agents unless necessary for imaging; and the use of nephrotoxic antibiotics unless judged necessary by the attending physician. Any use of the above-mentioned drugs after study entrance was recorded.\nRenal-replacement therapy was initiated if at least one of the following criteria was present: anuria, hyperkalemia with electrocardiographic changes, pure metabolic acidosis with a pH of less than 7.2, or a blood urea nitrogen level of more than 84 mg per deciliter (30 mmol per liter) or a creatinine level of more than 5.65 mg per deciliter (499 μmol per liter). Administration of sedative and analgesic drugs or muscle relaxants was left to the discretion of the clinician; doses were reassessed at least daily to achieve values ranging from −3 to 0 on the Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale (which ranges from −5 to 4, with lower scores indicating deeper sedation, 0 indicating a calm and responsive patient, and higher scores indicating increasing agitation); all doses of sedative and analgesic drugs were recorded daily.\nAfter enrollment, patients were assigned to vasopressor treatment that was adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg (high-target group) or 65 to 70 mm Hg (low-target group). The target mean arterial pressure was to be maintained for a maximum of 5 days or until the patient was weaned from vasopressor support; after that, the target pressure was determined by the attending physician. For patients in whom the assigned target pressure was not reached despite the administration of increasing doses of vasopressors, group assignments were not modified, and data analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. (The vasopressor-weaning strategy is described in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.)\nIn the high-target group, a reduction in vasopressor doses to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 70 mm Hg was recommended if any of the prespecified serious adverse events that were potentially related to an increased rate of vasopressor infusion occurred. These events were as follows: clinically relevant bleeding (i.e., transfusion requirements of at least 2 units of packed red cells), myocardial infarction (defined as typical electrocardiographic changes, with a concomitant increase in troponin, and segmental echocardiographic hypokinesia or akinesia, with the infarction confirmed, when possible, by means of coronary angiography), major ventricular arrhythmia, poorly tolerated supraventricular arrhythmia, mesenteric ischemia, and distal-limb ischemia. Data analysis for serious adverse events was performed for all patients on an intention\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
