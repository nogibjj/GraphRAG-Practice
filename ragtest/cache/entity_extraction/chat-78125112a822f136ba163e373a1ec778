At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group.\n\nResponders\nThe median time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal was 7 days in the placebo group and 9 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .49, Figure 3B). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 18 patients (53%) in the placebo group and in 18 patients (50%) in the corticosteroid group.\n\nAll Patients\nThe median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 9 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.10-2.16; P = .01; Figure 3C). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 64 patients (43%) in the placebo group and in 83 patients (55%) in the corticosteroid group.\n\nAdverse Events\nThere were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the rates of adverse events possibly related to corticosteroids or vasopressors, or related to ICU invasive procedures (Table 5).\n\nComment\nWe found that a 7-day replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (50 mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50 µg tablet once daily) significantly reduced 28-day mortality and duration of vasopressor administration in all patients with septic shock, in particular those with relative adrenal insufficiency. In addition, among the latter, corticosteroid therapy significantly reduced mortality during both ICU and hospital stays, and tended to reduce 1-year mortality. Our results indicate that, in this population, 1 additional life could be saved at day 28 for every 7 patients treated with corticosteroids. Replacement therapy had no significant effect on the same variables in patients who had septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency. If the power to detect differences in responders was lower than that in nonresponders due to the lower proportion of responders, it should be observed that no tendency toward efficacy (or deleterious effect) was observed in responders for any of the above mentioned variables. These results confirm the hypothesis on which the study was planned that patients with septic shock with relative adrenal insufficiency could benefit from replacement therapy.\n\nOur results are consistent with a study of healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin27 and with 2 studies of patients with septic shock,12,13 that showed that low doses of hydrocortisone can restore vascular responsiveness to catecholamines. Our results are also consistent with those of 2 small trials showing that replacement therapy with hydrocortisone reduces the time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Finally, our study establishes that a short corticotropin test performed at early onset of septic shock is useful for identifying patients that could most benefit from replacement therapy with corticosteroids. However, it has to be stressed that the time required to obtain the results largely depends on the method used to measure cortisol (eg, enzymatic method, radioimmunoassay) and therefore that treatment should be started as soon as the test has been completed.\n\nThe sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 20% between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate using a 1-sided formulation. Such a formulation was chosen because the preliminary reports that were available at the planning phase of the study22,23 had shown that for several days patients tolerated well 200 to 300 mg of hydrocortisone daily, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating a hypothetical deleterious effect of corticosteroids. However, as recommended by the 9th International Conference on Harmonization, at the time of analysis, all tests were performed using a 2-sided formulation and all reported P values were 2-sided. The sample size was also computed based on the assumptions of a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock. In fact, the mortality rate in the nonresponder placebo subgroup (63%) was much lower than expected compared with the reports that were available at the planning phase of the study7,22 and with the hypothesis that patients with adrenal insufficiency would very likely die without hormone replacement. Conversely, the proportion of nonresponders (77%) was much higher than expected and the resulting increase in the sample size of nonresponders (from 108 to 229) may have favored the detection of a lower difference (10%) than expected between the 2 groups.\n\nSeveral differences between the design of this positive study and previous negative studies28-33 deserve comment. First, our trial was focused on a very specific population who were presumed to benefit from corticosteroids because of relative adrenal insufficiency. Second, low doses of a combination of the natural hormone hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were used (as recommended to treat adrenal insufficiency)16 rather than high doses of a synthetic glucocorticoid compound. The addition of fludrocortisone to hydrocortisone was justified because primary adrenal insufficiency\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
