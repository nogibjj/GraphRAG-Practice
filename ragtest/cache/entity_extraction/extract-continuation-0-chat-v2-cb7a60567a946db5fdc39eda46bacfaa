The total amount of administered insulin was not significantly different between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups (safety set analysis: mean [SD], 264.6 [312.2] vs 212.2 [246.8] IU, respectively; difference, 52.4 IU; 95% CI, −21.8 to 126.7 IU; P = .17) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Two patients developed severe hypertension during hydrocortisone administration, which required antihypertensive therapy. Both patients recovered without sequelae. Secondary infections, weaning failure, muscle weakness, hypernatremia, or other adverse events were not significantly different between treatment groups (Table 3).\n\nCritical Illness–Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency\nCortisol data from corticotropin tests were available from 206 of 353 patients (58.4%), of whom 69 (33.5%) had CIRCI. Baseline characteristics were comparable between patients with and without CIRCI (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). In the placebo group, septic shock occurred in 10 of 37 patients with CIRCI (27.0%) and in 9 of 66 patients without CIRCI (13.6%) (difference, 13.4%; 95% CI, −2.1% to 30.5%; P = .09). In a multivariate analysis, SOFA score (per SOFA point: odds ratio = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.49; P = .007) and CIRCI (odds ratio = 2.58; 95% CI, 1.13-5.91; P = .03) at baseline, but not age or sex, were independently prognostic for development of septic shock (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). In this subpopulation of 206 patients, there was no significant difference regarding the primary or secondary end points between patients with or without CIRCI who received hydrocortisone or placebo (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).\n\nDelirium\nDelirium was assessed by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU in 286 of 353 patients (81.0%). The median number of assessments per patient was 7 (IQR, 4-12) in the placebo group and 6.5 (IQR, 4-10.5) in the hydrocortisone group (difference, 1.61 assessments; 95% CI, −0.36 to 3.58 assessments; P = .21). Twenty-six patients were excluded from analysis owing to low Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score or incomplete data. In the remaining 260 patients, delirium was less frequent in patients who received hydrocortisone than in those who received placebo (11 of 130 patients [8.5%] vs 25 of 130 patients [19.2%], respectively; difference, −10.8%; 95% CI, −19.2% to −2.3%; P = .01). The results remained significant after exclusion of another 60 patients (28 from the placebo group, 32 from the hydrocortisone group) who were diagnosed by the investigator to have no delirium but had at least 1 incomplete delirium assessment or had only 1 baseline assessment (n = 6 in the hydrocortisone group) (with delirium occurring in 11 of 98 patients [11.2%] in the hydrocortisone group vs 25 of 102 patients [24.5%] in the placebo group; difference, −13.3%; 95% CI, −23.7% to −2.6%; P = .01) (Table 2).\n\nDiscussion\nIn this RCT, low-dose hydrocortisone did not prevent the evolution from severe sepsis to septic shock. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to mortality or LOS in the ICU or hospital, or mortality up to 180 days. Patients treated with hydrocortisone had a significantly higher risk of developing hyperglycemia and a lower risk of developing delirium in a post hoc analysis.\n\nThe rationale for this study was based on the notion that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect stages of a disease continuum with increasing mortality.28 Occurrence of septic shock was chosen as the primary outcome variable for the following reasons. First, hydrocortisone in septic shock showed conflicting results in terms of mortality, but consistent hemodynamic effects and faster septic shock resolution.6,24 Second, administration of hydrocortisone was associated with immunomodulatory effects including reduced inducible nit\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A medication used in the study to treat severe sepsis and septic shock, associated with higher risk of hyperglycemia and lower risk of delirium\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACEBO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A control substance used in the study, compared against hydrocortisone in treating severe sepsis and septic shock\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRITICAL ILLNESS–RELATED CORTICOSTEROID INSUFFICIENCY (CIRCI)<|>EVENT<|>A condition studied in the context of severe sepsis and septic shock, with its presence being a prognostic factor for development of septic shock\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A severe condition resulting from sepsis, chosen as the primary outcome variable in the study, with hydrocortisone treatment showing conflicting mortality results but consistent hemodynamic effects\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELIRIUM<|>EVENT<|>A condition assessed in the study, found to be less frequent in patients treated with hydrocortisone compared to those receiving placebo\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>Hydrocortisone treatment for septic shock showed conflicting mortality results but consistent hemodynamic effects and faster resolution<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>DELIRIUM<|>Patients treated with hydrocortisone had a lower risk of developing delirium<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>HYPERGLYCEMIA<|>Hydrocortisone treatment was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing hyperglycemia<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRITICAL ILLNESS–RELATED CORTICOSTEROID INSUFFICIENCY (CIRCI)<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>Presence of CIRCI at baseline was independently prognostic for the development of septic shock<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
