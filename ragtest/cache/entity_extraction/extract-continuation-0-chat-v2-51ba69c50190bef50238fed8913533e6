Thus, a replacement therapy of low doses of corticosteroids has been proposed to treat septic shock.\n\nObjective To assess whether low doses of corticosteroids improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency.\n\nDesign and Setting Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial performed in 19 intensive care units in France from October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999.\n\nPatients Three hundred adult patients who fulfilled usual criteria for septic shock were enrolled after undergoing a short corticotropin test.\n\nIntervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrocortisone (50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50-Âµg tablet once daily) (n = 151) or matching placebos (n = 149) for 7 days.\n\nMain Outcome Measure Twenty-eight-day survival distribution in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency (nonresponders to the corticotropin test).\n\nResults One patient from the corticosteroid group was excluded from analyses because of consent withdrawal. There were 229 nonresponders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36). In nonresponders, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.95; P = .02). Vasopressor therapy was withdrawn within 28 days in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-2.84; P = .001). There was no significant difference between groups in responders. Adverse events rates were similar in the 2 groups.\n\nConclusion In our trial, a 7-day treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the risk of death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency without increasing adverse events.\n\nSevere sepsis remains an important cause of death, accounting for 9.3% of all deaths in the United States in 1995.1 If our understanding of the mechanisms of host response to stress has strongly progressed during the last 2 decades,2 the various drugs developed for specific targets of the cytokine cascade have failed to improve patient survival.3,4\n\nCorticosteroids were the first anti-inflammatory drugs tested in randomized trials. At high doses during short courses, they did not induce favorable effects.5,6 However, the observation that severe sepsis may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency7,8 or systemic inflammation-induced glucocorticoid receptor resistance9 prompted renewed interest of a replacement therapy with low doses of corticosteroids during longer periods.10,11\n\nThe interest of this new approach was confirmed by the demonstration that a single intravenous administration of 50 mg of hydrocortisone strongly improved norepinephrine and phenylephrine mean arterial pressure dose-response relationships in patients with septic shock,12,13 particularly in those with relative adrenal insufficiency.12 Moreover, 2 small placebo-controlled randomized trials also showed that prolonged treatment (â¥5 days) with low doses of hydrocortisone (about 300 mg daily) significantly improved the time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Thus, we designed this placebo-controlled study to assess whether a replacement therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone (assuming the possibility of a primary adrenal insufficiency)16 could improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock, with particular interest in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency.\n\nMethods\nExperimental Design and Study Organization\nThis placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was performed on 2 parallel groups at 19 intensive care units (ICUs) in France (Figure 1). It was supported by Groupe d'Etude et de Recherche sur le MÃ©dicament (GERMED), which awarded a grant from publicly funded resources. The protocol was approved by the ComitÃ© Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche BiomÃ©dicale of Saint-Germain en Laye, France, on February 9, 1995. Inclusions were authorized from September 11, 1995. Two interim analyses were planned. An independent main end point and safety monitoring board met after each interim analysis to decide whether the study should be continued or stopped. Enrollment ended March 15, 1999. At the end of the study, an independent diagnosis validation committee blindly classified each patient as being unquestionable, probable, or nonprobable for having had septic shock.\n\nPatients\nAll patients 18 years or older and hospitalized in participating ICUs were prospectively enrolled in the study if they met all the following criteria: (1) documented site (or at least strong suspicion) of infection, as evidenced by one or more of the following: presence of polymorphs in a normally sterile body fluid (except blood), positive culture or Gram stain of a normally sterile body fluid, clinical focus of infection (eg, fecal peritonitis), wound with purulent discharge, pneumonia or other clinical evidence of systemic infection (eg, purpura fulminans); (2) temperature higher than 38.3Â°C or lower than 35.6Â°C; (3) heart rate greater than\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>EVENT<|>A critical condition resulting from sepsis, leading to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY<|>EVENT<|>A condition where the adrenal glands release insufficient amounts of hormones, including cortisol, which may be linked to septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORTICOSTEROIDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Medications used as a treatment option for septic shock, aiming to replace low hormone levels in adrenal insufficiency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>Country where a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial on corticosteroids for septic shock was conducted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of corticosteroid medication used in the study to treat septic shock patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLUDROCORTISONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A corticosteroid medication used alongside hydrocortisone in the study to treat septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUPE D'ETUDE ET DE RECHERCHE SUR LE MÃDICAMENT (GERMED)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The organization that supported the septic shock study with a grant from publicly funded resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMITÃ CONSULTATIF DE PROTECTION DES PERSONNES DANS LA RECHERCHE BIOMÃDICALE OF SAINT-GERMAIN EN LAYE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The committee that approved the protocol for the septic shock study)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY<|>Septic shock may be associated with adrenal insufficiency, prompting the study on corticosteroid treatment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORTICOSTEROIDS<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>Corticosteroids were tested as a treatment for septic shock in the study<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>GROUPE D'ETUDE ET DE RECHERCHE SUR LE MÃDICAMENT (GERMED)<|>The study was conducted in France and supported by GERMED<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE<|>FLUDROCORTISONE<|>Both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were used in the study to treat septic shock<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROUPE D'ETUDE ET DE RECHERCHE SUR LE MÃDICAMENT (GERMED)<|>SEPTIC SHOCK<|>GERMED supported the study on corticosteroid treatment for septic shock<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMITÃ CONSULTATIF DE PROTECTION DES PERSONNES DANS LA RECHERCHE BIOMÃDICALE OF SAINT-GERMAIN EN LAYE<|>SEPTIC SHOCK STUDY<|>The committee approved the protocol for the septic shock study<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
