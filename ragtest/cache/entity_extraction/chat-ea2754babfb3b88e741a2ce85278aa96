Tapering was used because of the increase in proinflammatory mediators and hemodynamic deterioration after abrupt cessation of corticosteroids.17 Our study showed an increased incidence of superinfection, including new episodes of sepsis or septic shock, in the hydrocortisone group. Previous studies with high-dose corticosteroids have shown similar findings,11 whereas the study conducted by the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network32 using higher doses of corticosteroids and meta-analyses of studies that used low doses21,22 did not report higher rates of infectious complications.\nStudies involving critically ill patients have reported an association between corticosteroid therapy and the incidence of neuromuscular weakness.32,33 We did not see this in our study, although electrophysiological testing was not performed. However, the duration of mechanical ventilation was similar in the two study groups. Finally, the increased glucose levels in the hydrocortisone group may have contributed to increased mortality.34\nThe use of etomidate for induction of anesthesia in our study (in 26% of patients) was similar to that in the Annane study (24%). Etomidate has a low profile of cardiovascular complications,35 but a single dose can inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids for at least 24 hours in patients who are critically ill.36 An association between etomidate and the likelihood of adrenal hyporesponsiveness was also found in our study.\nThe prognostic importance of adrenal insufficiency in septic shock is well described.19 Routine testing of adrenal function has been advocated to guide corticosteroid therapy.16,18â€“21 In our study, a modest increase in the rate of death at 28 days was seen in patients who did not have a response to corticotropin (38%), as compared with those who had a response (29%). However, there was no difference in outcome in either subgroup of the hydrocortisone group. The short corticotropin test does not appear to be useful for determining the advisability of corticosteroid treatment in patients with septic shock, and our results call into question the definition of relative adrenal insufficiency. Indeed, significant variability in cortisol levels has been described, depending on the measurement methods used.37 Studies have described the poor relationship between total and free cortisol levels38 and other issues concerning the dose, timing, and type of corticotropin.39\nThe strengths of our study include the fact that it was initiated by the investigators and involved 52 ICUs in nine countries. Limitations include the lack of adequate power, since only 500 patients were enrolled rather than the projected 800. This was due to a combination of slow recruitment (which was probably related to a loss of equipoise in view of the various guidelines recommending corticosteroid use23), termination of funding, and time expiry of the trial drug. On the basis of the current data, however, the likelihood of seeing any difference in outcomes between the two study groups was unlikely. Finally, 21 patients received open-label corticosteroids (4.2%), although this finding was unlikely to have had a material effect on the outcome.\nIn summary, the use of hydrocortisone did not decrease mortality in a general population of patients with septic shock, even though the drug hastened reversal of shock. This lack of improvement may be related to an increased incidence of superinfection and new septic episodes. No benefit was seen in a subgroup of patients who had had no response to corticotropin, as was shown previously for patients with severe septic shock. This finding may be related to methodologic issues surrounding the accurate diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients or to a decreased prognostic importance of this phenomenon in less severe shock. On the basis of these findings, hydrocortisone cannot be recommended as general adjuvant therapy for septic shock (vasopressor responsive), nor can corticotropin testing be recommended to determine which patients should receive hydrocortisone therapy. Hydrocortisone may have a role among patients who are treated early after the onset of septic shock who remain hypotensive despite the administration of high-dose vasopressors (vasopressor unresponsive).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
