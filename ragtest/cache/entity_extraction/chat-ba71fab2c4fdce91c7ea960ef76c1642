The number of days alive and free of vasopressors and organ failure was higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo. The risk of secondary infections, gastroduodenal bleeding, or neurologic sequelae was not significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo, but the risk of hyperglycemia was significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone. There was some imbalance between the two groups in the distribution of pathogens, with slightly more viral infections in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group than in the placebo group.\nThe mechanisms by which corticosteroids may favorably affect the outcome of patients with septic shock have been detailed recently.7 In brief, corticosteroids improve cardiovascular function by restoring effective blood volume through increased mineralocorticoid activity and by increasing systemic vascular resistance, an effect that is partly related to endothelial glucocorticoid receptors.20 This might explain why in our trial there was less need for vasopressors with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo. Corticosteroids attenuate inflammation in various organs in both animals and humans with sepsis, an effect partly related to inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB).21 In our trial, hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy accelerated the resolution of organ failure in adults with septic shock.\nWith respect to 90-day all-cause mortality, there was an absolute difference of 6 percentage points and a relative difference of 12% that favored hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone over placebo; these findings are in keeping with those of a recent Cochrane review.8 In this systematic review, only 2 of 33 trials were powered to address the effects of a long (≥5 days) course of low-dose corticosteroids on mortality.8 The first trial (Ger-Inf-05), in which patients received hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone or matching placebos for 7 days, showed an absolute difference of 6 percentage points in 28-day mortality in favor of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone.11 The second trial (Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock [CORTICUS]) showed no significant survival benefit from an 11-day course of hydrocortisone alone.12 In a more recent trial involving 380 adults with severe sepsis (Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Septic Shock [HYPRESS]),22 hydrocortisone alone failed to prevent septic shock. That trial was not powered to address the effects of hydrocortisone on mortality and excluded patients with shock.\nThere are two main differences between trials that showed a survival benefit from corticosteroid therapy (APROCCHSS and Ger-Inf-05) and those that did not (CORTICUS and HYPRESS). First, in the APROCCHSS and Ger-Inf-05 trials, fludrocortisone was added to hydrocortisone to provide additional mineralocorticoid potency. It was administered enterally in the absence of an intravenous formulation of this drug. The rationale for adding mineralocorticoid treatment is that an experimental sepsis study showed marked NF-κB–mediated down-regulation of vascular mineralocorticoid receptors.23 Treatment with aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid-receptor agonist, restored α1-adrenoceptor expression, improved contractile response to phenylephrine, and improved survival in mice with endotoxic shock. In a recent pharmacokinetic study involving adults with septic shock, enteral administration of 50 μg of fludrocortisone resulted in plasma concentrations of the drug that exerted significant mineralocorticoid effects, with some interindividual variability.24\nSecond, the APROCCHSS and Ger-Inf-05 trials focused on patients with septic shock whose condition did not improve after initial resuscitation according to the 6-hour bundle of care outlined in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.17 For these patients, norepinephrine at a dose of more than 0.25 μg per kilogram per minute for more than 6 hours was required in order for hemodynamic stabilization to be achieved. This group of patients was selected because they may be at high risk for death, which makes them the best target group for adjunct therapy.15 The crude in-hospital mortality of 45.3% that was observed in the placebo group of the APROCCHSS trial is close to that reported by the Sepsis-3 task force.1,2 Patients in the APROCCHSS trial were sicker than those in the CORTICUS trial, as evidenced by higher SOFA scores (by approximately 1.5 points) and higher SAPS II values (by approximately 7 points), and were more likely to be admitted from medical wards. Hence, the Ger-Inf-05 and APROCCHSS trials independently showed a survival benefit with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone in adults with septic shock and persistent vasopressor dependency and organ failures.\nAlthough this trial could not assess the potential interaction between drotrecogin alfa (activated) and corticosteroids, this question is no longer relevant since the withdrawal of Xigris from the market in 2011.
