The trial was completed on December 23, 2015 (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Table 1 shows the primary baseline characteristics of the patients. (See also Tables S1 through S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.) Patient demographic data, severity-of-illness scores, characteristics of infection, and treatments at baseline were similar in the two groups. Most patients were admitted from a medical ward and had severe septic shock, as evidenced by high Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) values (range, 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating greater severity of illness), high lactate levels, and a high degree of vasopressor dependency (mean dose of norepinephrine, 1 Î¼g per kilogram per minute). Most patients had community-acquired infection, and the lung was the most common site of infection. The initial antimicrobial treatment was judged adequate (by the steering committee, according to the site of infection and the sensitivity of the pathogens) in 96.2% of the patients who received placebo and 96.9% of those who received corticosteroids (Tables S2, S5, and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 1\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients.\nOutcomes\n90-Day All-Cause Mortality\nAt day 90, death had occurred in 264 of 614 patients (43.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 39.0 to 47.0) in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group and in 308 of 627 patients (49.1%; 95% CI, 45.1 to 53.1) in the placebo group (P=0.03) (Table 2 and Figure 1). The relative risk of death was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.99) in favor of hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy.\nFigure 1\n\n90-Day Survival Distributions.\nTable 2\n\nTrial Outcomes.\nSecondary Outcomes\nMortality was significantly lower in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group than in the placebo group at ICU discharge (35.4% [217 of 613 patients] vs. 41.0% [257 of 627 patients], P=0.04), hospital discharge (39.0% [239 of 613 patients] vs. 45.3% [284 of 627 patients], P=0.02), and day 180 (46.6% [285 of 611 patients] vs. 52.5% [328 of 625 patients], P=0.04) (Table 2, and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group had a significantly shorter time than those in the placebo group to weaning from mechanical ventilation (P=0.006), to weaning from vasopressor therapy (P<0.001), and to reaching a SOFA score below 6 (P<0.001) (Figure 2, and Figs. S3 through S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Similarly, patients in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group had significantly more vasopressor-free days to day 28 than those in the placebo group (P<0.001) and significantly more organ-failureâfree days to day 28 (P=0.003) (Table 2, and Tables S8 and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nTime to Weaning from Vasopressors, to Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation, and to Reaching a SOFA Score below 6.\nSerious Adverse Events\nA total of 326 of 614 patients (53.1%) in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group and 363 of 626 patients (58.0%) in the placebo group had at least one serious adverse event by day 180 (P=0.08) (Table 3). The risk of gastroduodenal bleeding was not significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.34; P=0.56), nor was the risk of superinfection (relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.30; P=0.30). However, the risk of hyperglycemia was significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone (relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.12; P=0.002).\nTable 3\n\nAdverse Events.\nDiscussion\nIn this trial involving adults with septic shock, all-cause mortality was lower with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo at day 90, at discharge from the ICU and hospital, and at day 180. The time to weaning from vasopressors, to weaning from mechanical ventilation, and to reaching a SOFA score below 6 was shorter with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo. The number of days alive and free of vasopressors and organ failure was higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo. The risk of secondary infections, gastroduodenal bleeding, or neurologic sequelae was not significantly higher with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than with placebo, but the risk\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE-PLUS-FLUDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group in a clinical trial that received hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone treatment, showing lower mortality and faster recovery in septic shock patients compared to placebo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group in a clinical trial that received a placebo treatment, showing higher mortality and slower recovery in septic shock patients compared to the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROCORTISONE-PLUS-FLUDROCORTISONE GROUP<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>The hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group showed significantly better outcomes than the placebo group in terms of mortality and recovery times in septic shock patients<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
