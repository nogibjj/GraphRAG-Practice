(Appendix 1).26 Patients were eligible for the trial if they had a known or suspected infection on the basis of clinical data at the time of screening and if they met the following criteria within a 24-hour period: three or more signs of systemic inflammation and the sepsis-induced dysfunction of at least one organ or system that lasted no longer than 24 hours. Patients had to begin treatment within 24 hours after they met the inclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria are summarized in Appendix 2.\nTreatment Assignments\nPatients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive drotrecogin alfa activated or placebo (0.9 percent saline with or without 0.1 percent human serum albumin) at each center. Block randomization stratified according to site was used, and all assignments were made through a central randomization center. Drotrecogin alfa activated, at a dose of 24 μg per kilogram of body weight per hour, or placebo was administered intravenously at a constant rate from foil-wrapped bags for a total duration of 96 hours. The patients, investigators, and the sponsor were unaware of the patients' treatment assignments. Drotrecogin alfa activated was produced from an established mammalian cell line into which the complementary DNA for human protein C had been inserted.27\nThe infusion was interrupted 1 hour before any percutaneous procedure or major surgery and was resumed 1 hour and 12 hours later, respectively, in the absence of bleeding complications. The study protocol did not call for a standardized approach to critical care (e.g., the use of antibiotics, fluids, vasopressors, or ventilatory support).\nEvaluation of Patients\nPatients were followed for 28 days after the start of the infusion or until death. Base-line characteristics including demographic information and information on preexisting conditions, organ function, markers of disease severity, infection, and hematologic and other laboratory tests were assessed within 24 hours before the infusion was begun. Blood samples obtained at base line, on days 1 through 7, and on days 14 and 28 were assayed for D-dimer levels (Liatest D-D1 latex agglutination test kit, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France) and for interleukin-6 levels (Quantikine HS enzyme immunoassay kit, R & D Systems, Minneapolis). All measurements were performed by a central laboratory (Covance Central Lab Services, Indianapolis). Blood samples for the measurement of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C were collected on days 14 and 28 or at the time of discharge from the hospital if it occurred before one or both of these dates. Microbiologic-culture results were assessed each day beginning 48 hours after the initiation of the infusion and continuing through day 28. Patients were defined as having a deficiency of protein C if their plasma protein C activity level was below the lower limit of normal (81 percent) within 24 hours before the initiation of the infusion and defined as having septic shock if they met the criteria for cardiovascular dysfunction at any time within 6 hours before the start of the infusion.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe primary efficacy end point was death from any cause and was assessed 28 days after the initiation of the infusion. Our prospectively defined primary analysis included all patients who received the infusion for any length of time, with patients analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were assigned at randomization. The trial was designed to enroll 2280 patients; two planned interim analyses by an independent data and safety monitoring board occurred after 760 and 1520 patients had been enrolled. Statistical guidelines to suspend enrollment if drotrecogin alfa activated was found to be significantly more efficacious than placebo were determined a priori and used the O'Brien–Fleming spending function according to the method of Lan and DeMets.28\nData were analyzed according to a prospectively defined plan. The primary analysis was based on a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test in which the groups were stratified on the basis of three baseline covariates: severity of disease, as reflected by the score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)29 (3 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, or 30 to 53, with higher scores indicating more severe disease); age (younger than 60 years or 60 years or older); and plasma protein C activity level (40 percent or less, 41 to 60 percent, 61 to 80 percent, 81 percent or more, or unknown). The corresponding relative risk and 95 percent confidence interval were calculated with use of the logit-adjusted method. The time from the start of the infusion to death was compared in the two groups in a similar manner with use of a stratified log-rank test. Results of both stratified and nonstratified analyses are reported. We evaluated the consistency of the effects of treatment on the risk of death in the subgroups by determining whether the relative risk and 95 percent confidence interval for each subgroup included the observed relative risk for the entire population.\nChanges from base-line levels of plasma D-dimer and serum interleukin-6 were analyzed in patients who had subsequent measurements with the use of analysis of variance of ranked data. For patients with missing data, we used the last-observation-carried-forward method of imputation. The proportion of patients who had serious adverse events and new infections was compared in the two groups with the use of Pearson's chi-square tests. All reported P values are two-sided.\nResults\nAt\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A medication used in the treatment of severe sepsis, administered intravenously at a dose of 24 μg per kilogram of body weight per hour for a total duration of 96 hours)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACEBO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A control treatment in the study, consisting of 0.9 percent saline with or without 0.1 percent human serum albumin, administered in the same manner as the active medication)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL RANDOMIZATION CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The facility responsible for the random assignment of patients to either the drotrecogin alfa activated treatment or placebo in a 1:1 manner, ensuring the blinding of treatment assignments)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVANCE CENTRAL LAB SERVICES, INDIANAPOLIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The central laboratory responsible for assaying blood samples for D-dimer and interleukin-6 levels during the study)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>CENTRAL RANDOMIZATION CENTER<|>Drotrecogin alfa activated was assigned to patients through the Central Randomization Center as part of the study's treatment protocol<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLACEBO<|>CENTRAL RANDOMIZATION CENTER<|>Placebo was assigned to patients through the Central Randomization Center as part of the study's control group protocol<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVANCE CENTRAL LAB SERVICES, INDIANAPOLIS<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>Covance Central Lab Services, Indianapolis, performed blood assays to measure the effects of drotrecogin alfa activated<|>4)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVANCE CENTRAL LAB SERVICES, INDIANAPOLIS<|>PLACEBO<|>Covance Central Lab Services, Indianapolis, performed blood assays to measure the effects of placebo<|>4)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
