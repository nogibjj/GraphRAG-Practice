Overall, there were 86 deaths in the hydrocortisone group (34.3%; 95% CI, 28.3 to 40.2) and 78 deaths in the placebo group (31.5%; 95% CI, 25.6 to 37.3; P=0.51).\nNo differences in mortality were seen between the study groups or between the corticotropin subgroups at any other time point (Figure 2 and Table 3). Twenty-one post hoc analyses were performed to elucidate the reasons for the rates of death at 28 days in subgroups of patients. These analyses showed that among patients with a systolic blood pressure persisting at less than 90 mm Hg within 30 hours after study entry, 31 of 69 patients in the hydrocortisone group (44.9%) and 32 of 57 patients in the placebo group (56.1%) had died, with an absolute difference in the hydrocortisone group of –11.2% (95% CI, –18.6 to 6.2; P=0.28); among those whose systolic blood pressure was measured at 90 mm Hg or more within 30 hours after study entry, 55 of 181 in the hydrocortisone group (30.4%) and 46 of 189 in the placebo group (24.3%) died, with an absolute difference in the hydrocortisone group of 6.1% (95% CI, −3.0 to 15.1; P=0.20). In post hoc analyses, the rates of death among the 384 patients who received a study drug within 12 hours after baseline were similar in the two groups: 73 of 198 patients in the hydrocortisone group (36.9%) and 58 of 186 patients in the placebo group (31.2%, P=0.28) (Table 3 of the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Curves for Survival at 28 Days.\nTable 3\n\nOutcomes According to Subgroup.\nPost hoc analyses also revealed an increased rate of death at 28 days among patients who received etomidate before randomization in both groups (23 of 51 in the hydrocortisone group [45.1%] and 18 of 45 in the placebo group [40.0%]), as compared with patients who did not receive etomidate (63 of 200 in the hydrocortisone group [31.5%] and 60 of 203 in the placebo group [29.6%, P=0.03]).\nReversal of Shock\nThe proportions of patients who underwent a reversal of shock were similar among patients who did not have a response to corticotropin: 95 of 125 in the hydrocortisone group (76.0%; 95% CI, 68.5 to 83.5) and 76 of 108 in the placebo group (70.4%; 95% CI, 61.8 to 79.0; P=0.41); among patients who had a response to corticotropin: 100 of 118 patients in the hydrocortisone group (84.7%; 95% CI, 78.3 to 91.2) and 104 of 136 in the placebo group (76.5%; 95% CI, 69.3 to 83.6; P=0.13); and among all patients: 200 of 251 in the hydrocortisone group (79.7%; 95% CI, 74.7 to 84.7) and 184 of 248 in the placebo group (74.2%; 95% CI, 68.7 to 79.6; P=0.18).\nThe duration of time until the reversal of shock was significantly shorter among patients receiving hydrocortisone for all patients (P<0.001), for those who had a response to corticotropin (P<0.001), and for those who did not have a response to corticotropin (P=0.06) (Figure 3). The median time until reversal of shock was also shorter in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group: for all patients, 3.3 days (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.9) versus 5.8 days (95% CI, 5.2 to 6.9); for those who had a response to corticotropin, 2.8 days (95% CI, 2.1 to 3.3) versus 5.8 days (95% CI, 5.2 to 6.9); and for those who did not have a response, 3.9 days (95% CI, 3.0 to 5.2) versus 6.0 days (95% CI, 4.9 to 9.0).\nFigure 3\n\nKaplan–Meier Curves for the Time to Reversal of Shock.\nThe number of extubated patients on day 28 was similar in the two study groups: 119 of 228 patients who underwent ventilation at baseline in the hydrocortisone group (52%) and 113 of 212 patients in the placebo group (53%).
