However, the benefits and harms of different hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion have not been established.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who had septic shock and a hemoglobin concentration of 9 g per deciliter or less to receive 1 unit of leukoreduced red cells when the hemoglobin level was 7 g per deciliter or less (lower threshold) or when the level was 9 g per deciliter or less (higher threshold) during the ICU stay. The primary outcome measure was death by 90 days after randomization.\nResults\nWe analyzed data from 998 of 1005 patients (99.3%) who underwent randomization. The two intervention groups had similar baseline characteristics. In the ICU, the lower-threshold group received a median of 1 unit of blood (interquartile range, 0 to 3) and the higher-threshold group received a median of 4 units (interquartile range, 2 to 7). At 90 days after randomization, 216 of 502 patients (43.0%) assigned to the lower-threshold group, as compared with 223 of 496 (45.0%) assigned to the higher-threshold group, had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.09; P=0.44). The results were similar in analyses adjusted for risk factors at baseline and in analyses of the per-protocol populations. The numbers of patients who had ischemic events, who had severe adverse reactions, and who required life support were similar in the two intervention groups.\nConclusions\nAmong patients with septic shock, mortality at 90 days and rates of ischemic events and use of life support were similar among those assigned to blood transfusion at a higher hemoglobin threshold and those assigned to blood transfusion at a lower threshold; the latter group received fewer transfusions. (Funded by the Danish Strategic Research Council and others; TRISS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01485315.)\nBlood transfusions are frequently given to patients with septic shock.1–4 Some of these transfusions are given to patients who are bleeding, but many nonbleeding patients also undergo transfusion.5\nThe recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign regarding blood transfusion in patients with septic shock are complex and include a recommendation for transfusion to maintain a hematocrit of more than 30% in the presence of hypoperfusion in the first 6 hours. 6 After that, the transfusion threshold should be a hemoglobin level of less than 7 g per deciliter, aiming at levels between 7 g and 9 g per deciliter in patients who do not have myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, acute hemorrhage, or ischemic coronary artery disease.6 However, there are limited data supporting these recommendations,6 and many clinicians may not follow them.4,7 New trial data have been published recently,8 and the use of a high hemoglobin threshold for transfusion may be at least questioned as part of an early resuscitation protocol for patients with septic shock.\nBlood transfusion has been associated with increased mortality in subgroups of critically ill patients, both in cohort studies and in randomized trials,9–12 but there have also been cohort studies in which transfusion was associated with improved survival,13 including among patients with sepsis.14 In some studies, nonleukoreduced blood was used, which may have influenced the results. Given the lack of efficacy data, in addition to concerns about safety, we conducted the Transfusion Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial to evaluate the effects on mortality of leukoreduced blood transfusion at a lower versus a higher hemoglobin threshold among patients with septic shock who are in the intensive care unit (ICU).\nMethods\nTrial Design and Oversight\nAfter the approvals from ethics committees and data-protection agencies were obtained, patients in 32 general ICUs in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland underwent screening and randomization between December 3, 2011, and December 26, 2013. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or their legal surrogates before or after enrollment. In all cases, consent was obtained from the patient when possible. If consent was withdrawn or not granted, we asked the patient or surrogate for permission to continue registration of trial data and to use these data in the analyses. The protocol, including details regarding trial conduct and the statistical analysis plan, has been published previously15 and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The management committee (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org) designed the trial and vouches for the adherence of the study to the protocol and for the accuracy of the data and the analyses. The members of the management committee wrote the drafts of the manuscript and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The funders had no role in the design of the protocol, the trial conduct, or the analyses or reporting of the data.\nThis trial was a multicenter, stratified, parallel-group, clinical trial. Randomization was performed with the use of a centralized computer-generated assignment sequence, with stratification according to study site and the presence or absence of active hematologic cancer, because these characteristics may influence outcome.16,17 Patients with septic shock were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of permuted blocks of varying sizes of 6, 8, or 10, to blood transfusion at the higher hemoglobin threshold or the lower hemoglobin threshold. Treatment assignments were concealed from the investigators assessing mortality\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
