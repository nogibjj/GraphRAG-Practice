However, of the patients who survived to hospital discharge, those assigned to standard therapy had stayed a significantly longer time in the hospital than those assigned to early goal-directed therapy (18.4±15.0 vs. 14.6±14.5 days, P=0.04).\nDiscussion\nSevere sepsis and septic shock are common and are associated with substantial mortality and substantial consumption of health care resources. There are an estimated 751,000 cases (3.0 cases per 1000 population) of sepsis or septic shock in the United States each year, and they are responsible for as many deaths each year as acute myocardial infarction (215,000, or 9.3 percent of all deaths).29 In elderly persons, the incidence of sepsis or septic shock and the related mortality rates are substantially higher than those in younger persons. The projected growth of the elderly population in the United States will contribute to an increase in incidence of 1.5 percent per year, yielding an estimated 934,000 and 1,110,000 cases by the years 2010 and 2020, respectively.29 The present annual cost of this disease is estimated to be $16.7 billion.29\nThe transition from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome to severe sepsis and septic shock involves a myriad of pathogenic changes, including circulatory abnormalities that result in global tissue hypoxia.1,2 These pathogenic changes have been the therapeutic target of previous outcome studies.12 Although this transition occurs over time, both out of the hospital and in the hospital, in outcome studies interventions have usually been initiated after admission to the intensive care unit.12 In studies of goal-directed hemodynamic optimization, in particular, there was no benefit in terms of outcome with respect to normal and supranormal hemodynamic end points, as well as those guided by mixed venous oxygen saturation.9,13 In contrast, even though we enrolled patients with lower central venous oxygen saturation and lower central venous pressure than those studied by Gattinoni et al.9 and with a higher lactate concentration than those studied by Hayes et al.,13 we found significant benefits with respect to outcome when goal-directed therapy was applied at an earlier stage of disease. In patients with septic shock, for example, Hayes et al. observed a higher in-hospital mortality rate with aggressive hemodynamic optimization in the intensive care unit (71 percent) than with control therapy (52 percent), whereas we observed a lower mortality rate in patients with septic shock assigned to early goal-directed therapy (42.3 percent) than in those assigned to standard therapy (56.8 percent).\nThe benefits of early goal-directed therapy in terms of outcome are multifactorial. The incidence of death due to sudden cardiovascular collapse in the standard-therapy group was approximately double that in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, suggesting that an abrupt transition to severe disease is an important cause of early death. The early identification of patients with insidious illness (global tissue hypoxia accompanied by stable vital signs) makes possible the early implementation of goal-directed therapy. If sudden cardiovascular collapse can be prevented, the subsequent need for vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and pulmonary-artery catheterization (and their associated risks) diminishes. In addition to being a stimulus of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, global tissue hypoxia independently contributes to endothelial activation and disruption of the homeostatic balance among coagulation, vascular permeability, and vascular tone.30 These are key mechanisms leading to microcirculatory failure, refractory tissue hypoxia, and organ dysfunction.2,30 When early therapy is not comprehensive, the progression to severe disease may be well under way at the time of admission to the intensive care unit.16 Aggressive hemodynamic optimization and other therapy12 undertaken thereafter may be incompletely effective or even deleterious.13\nThe value of measurements of venous oxygen saturation at the right atrium or superior vena cava (central venous oxygen saturation) instead of at the pulmonary artery (mixed venous oxygen saturation) has been debated,31 in particular, when saturation values are above 65 percent. In patients in the intensive care unit who have hyperdynamic septic shock, the mixed venous oxygen saturation is rarely below 65 percent.32 In contrast, our patients were examined during the phase of resuscitation in which the delivery of supplemental oxygen is required (characterized by a decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation and an increased lactate concentration), when the central venous oxygen saturation generally exceeds the mixed venous oxygen saturation.33,34 The initial central venous oxygen saturation was less than 50 percent in both study groups. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is estimated to be 5 to 13 percent lower in the pulmonary artery33 and 15 percent lower in the splanchnic bed.35 Though not numerically equivalent, these ranges of values are pathologically equivalent and are associated with high mortality.32,36 Among all the patients in the current study in whom the goals with respect to central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and urine output during the first six hours were met, 39.8 percent of those assigned to standard therapy were still in this oxygen-dependent phase of resuscitation at six hours, as compared with 5.1 percent of those\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
