We hypothesized that therapy with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone or with drotrecogin alfa (activated), which can modulate the host response, would improve the clinical outcomes of patients with septic shock.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design, we evaluated the effect of hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy, drotrecogin alfa (activated), the combination of the three drugs, or their respective placebos. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and hospital discharge and at day 28 and day 180 and the number of days alive and free of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, or organ failure. After drotrecogin alfa (activated) was withdrawn from the market, the trial continued with a two-group parallel design. The analysis compared patients who received hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone with those who did not (placebo group).\nResults\nAmong the 1241 patients included in the trial, the 90-day mortality was 43.0% (264 of 614 patients) in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group and 49.1% (308 of 627 patients) in the placebo group (P=0.03). The relative risk of death in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.99). Mortality was significantly lower in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group than in the placebo group at ICU discharge (35.4% vs. 41.0%, P=0.04), hospital discharge (39.0% vs. 45.3%, P=0.02), and day 180 (46.6% vs. 52.5%, P=0.04) but not at day 28 (33.7% and 38.9%, respectively; P=0.06). The number of vasopressor-free days to day 28 was significantly higher in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group than in the placebo group (17 vs. 15 days, P<0.001), as was the number of organ-failure–free days (14 vs. 12 days, P=0.003). The number of ventilator-free days was similar in the two groups (11 days in the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group and 10 in the placebo group, P=0.07). The rate of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups, but hyperglycemia was more common in hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group.\nConclusions\nIn this trial involving patients with septic shock, 90-day all-cause mortality was lower among those who received hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than among those who received placebo. (Funded by Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique 2007 of the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health; APROCCHSS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00625209.)\nSeptic shock is characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection, resulting in life-threatening circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities.1 The short-term mortality is approximately 45 to 50%,2 and 50% of survivors of sepsis may have subsequent long-term cognitive decline.3 Apart from early hemodynamic and respiratory resuscitation and appropriate antiinfective treatments, there is no approved adjunct therapy for sepsis.4 A human recombinant activated protein C, drotrecogin alpha (activated), initially showed a survival benefit in sepsis; this benefit was not confirmed in subsequent trials, resulting in the withdrawal of its commercial form (Xigris) from the market.5,6\nExperimental and clinical evidence suggests that sepsis is associated with a dysregulated response of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis that may involve any of the steps from cortisol production to cortisol use by cells.7 Corticosteroids have been used in the treatment of patients with severe infections since the mid-twentieth century. However, their benefit-to-risk ratio, albeit evaluated in numerous trials, remains controversial. Quantitative analysis of these trials has variably confirmed8 or refuted9 the survival benefit of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis. This has resulted in substantial heterogeneity in physicians’ clinical practice, with approximately one third of physicians believing that corticosteroids improve survival in septic shock, one third believing that they do not, and one third being unsure.10\nThis uncertainty about the use of corticosteroids may relate to the differences in the results of the two largest trials.11,12 Although both trials showed treatment benefits in terms of hemodynamic status and organ function, only one trial11 showed survival benefits. The divergent findings may have resulted from differences in the design of the trials.13 To resolve this discrepancy, we designed a trial to test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy or drotrecogin alfa (activated) would improve the clinical outcomes of patients with septic shock.\nMethods\nTrial Design and Oversight\nInformation on the design and conduct of the Activated Protein C and Corticosteroids for Human Septic Shock (APROCCHSS) trial, including the trial protocol and amendments and the statistical\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
