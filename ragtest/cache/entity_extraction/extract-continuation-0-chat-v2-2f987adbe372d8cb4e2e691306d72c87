The combined 56.5 percent in-hospital mortality of this 39.8 percent of patients, who were at high risk for hemodynamic compromise, is consistent with the results of previous studies in the intensive care unit.32,36\nIn an open, randomized, partially blinded trial, there are unavoidable interactions during the initial period of the study. As the study progressed, the patients in the standard-therapy group may have received some form of goal-directed therapy, reducing the treatment effect. This reduction may have been offset by the slight but inherent bias resulting from the direct influence of the investigators on the care of the patients in the treatment group. The potential period of bias was 9.9±19.5 percent of the overall hospital stay in the standard-therapy group and 7.2±12.0 percent of that in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy (P=0.20). This interval was minimal in comparison with those in previous studies9,13 because the clinicians who assumed responsibility for the remainder of hospitalization were completely blinded to the randomization order.\nWe conclude that goal-directed therapy provided at the earliest stages of severe sepsis and septic shock, though accounting for only a brief period in comparison with the overall hospital stay, has significant short-term and long-term benefits. These benefits arise from the early identification of patients at high risk for cardiovascular collapse and from early therapeutic intervention to restore a balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen demand. In the future, investigators conducting outcome trials in patients with sepsis should consider the quality and timing of the resuscitation before enrollment as an important outcome variable.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD THERAPY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A treatment approach in the study for severe sepsis and septic shock that met certain goals but resulted in a high percentage of patients still in an oxygen-dependent phase after six hours)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EARLY GOAL-DIRECTED THERAPY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A treatment approach in the study for severe sepsis and septic shock that focuses on early intervention to balance oxygen delivery and demand, showing significant short-term and long-term benefits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTENSIVE CARE UNIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A hospital unit where patients with severe sepsis and septic shock were studied, showing high mortality rates associated with hemodynamic compromise)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD THERAPY<|>EARLY GOAL-DIRECTED THERAPY<|>Patients assigned to standard therapy showed a higher percentage in an oxygen-dependent phase compared to those assigned to early goal-directed therapy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANDARD THERAPY<|>INTENSIVE CARE UNIT<|>The study involving standard therapy was conducted in the context of the intensive care unit, showing high in-hospital mortality<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EARLY GOAL-DIRECTED THERAPY<|>INTENSIVE CARE UNIT<|>The study involving early goal-directed therapy was conducted in the context of the intensive care unit, showing significant benefits<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
