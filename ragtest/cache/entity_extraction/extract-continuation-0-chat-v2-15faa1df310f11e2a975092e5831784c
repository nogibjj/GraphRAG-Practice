We required that patients remain refractory to reasonable attempts to wean vasopressors and begin study treatment within 24 hours after the first dose of a vasopressor. (Full details regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.)\nPatients with coexisting illnesses with a high risk of death (e.g., metastatic cancer) were excluded. The clinical coordinating center confirmed the eligibility of each patient before randomization.\nStudy Treatments\nA centralized system randomly assigned patients to receive an intravenous infusion of DrotAA (Xigris, Eli Lilly) at a dose of 24 Î¼g per kilogram of body weight per hour for 96 hours or matching placebo dissolved in 0.9% saline solution. Study-group assignments were concealed from patients, investigators, treating clinicians, and the sponsor. Temporary interruptions of the study infusion were mandated for invasive procedures; in such cases, the infusion was extended through day 6 (the treatment period) so that the 96-hour infusion could be completed wherever possible. All other treatments were at the discretion of treating clinicians.\nEvaluation of Patients\nWe assessed baseline demographic characteristics, preexisting conditions, organ function, sites of infection, microbiology results, and hematologic and laboratory measurements within 24 hours before the administration of a study drug. Blood samples for the measurement of protein C levels were collected on days 1 through 7. Assays to assess protein C activity were performed on an STA Compact coagulation analyzer with the use of the STA-Staclot protein C kit (Diagnostica Stago). Patients were followed until either 90 days or death.\nPrimary and Secondary Outcomes\nThe primary outcome was death at 28 days. Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality in patients with severe protein C deficiency (plasma concentration, â¤50% of the lower limit of the normal range), 90-day mortality, measures of organ dysfunction, and safety. We examined heterogeneity of the treatment effect on mortality at 28 and 90 days in prespecified subgroups, as defined by the following baseline characteristics: APACHE II score (<25 or â¥25), number of organs that had failed, presence or absence of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the quartile of time from the onset of shock to the initiation of study treatment, plasma protein C level, glucocorticoid treatment, prophylactic heparin administration, recent surgery, and platelet count.\nWe assessed organ function using Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (on a scale of 0 to 4 for each organ system, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction). We used the SOFA score to measure the change from baseline to study day 7, using the mean arterial pressure and vasopressor dose to measure cardiovascular function, the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to the fraction of inspired oxygen to measure respiratory function, and the serum creatinine level to measure renal function.\nStudy Oversight\nThe steering committee designed the study in collaboration with the sponsor, Eli Lilly, as reported previously.9 Coauthors from the Duke Clinical Research Institute performed the analysis. The steering committee wrote the first draft of the manuscript, and the two first coauthors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. All authors had full and independent access to all the data and vouch for the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of the analysis and its fidelity to the study protocol.10\nStatistical Analysis\nWe determined that the planned enrollment of 1500 patients would provide a power of 80% at a significance level of 0.05 to detect an absolute difference of 7 percentage points (20% relative risk reduction) in the primary outcome of 28-day mortality from the placebo rate of 35%. An independent data and safety monitoring board conducted interim analyses, as described previously.9 The protocol specified an increase in sample size if the 28-day mortality for 750 patients was less than 30%.\nThe final primary analysis used a P value of less than 0.05 with adjustment for interim analyses of the cumulative data. The 28-day primary efficacy analysis was conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle and documented in the statistical analysis plan, as described previously.9â11 Patients with unknown survival status at 28 days or 90 days were excluded from the landmark analyses. In the time-to-event analyses, data for patients with unknown survival status were censored on the last day that patients were known to be alive.\nWe used a Cox proportional-hazards model to estimate the hazard ratio for death with the use of DrotAA versus placebo. We used a log-rank test to assess differences in survival curves between the two groups in the time-to-event analysis through 28 days and 90 days. Survival estimates were calculated with the use of the KaplanâMeier method. We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess between-group differences in SOFA scores. Similarly, we used ranked analysis of variance to assess the change in protein C level from baseline to day 7 and to compare the two study groups. We used the BreslowâDay test for homogeneity of odds ratios to determine differences in the treatment effect across categories for each of the prespecified subgroups at 28 days. All safety analyses were conducted in the population of treated patients.\nResults\nStudy Patients\nAggregate mortality after recruitment of 750 patients was 27.6%. Therefore, we increased the sample size to 1696 on May 12, 2010. Patients were enrolled from March 2008 through August 2011 at 208 sites in Europe, North and South America,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DROTRAA (XIGRIS, ELI LILLY)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DrotAA (Xigris, Eli Lilly) is a drug administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 24 Î¼g per kilogram of body weight per hour for 96 hours in a study to assess its efficacy in patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELI LILLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eli Lilly is the pharmaceutical company that produces DrotAA (Xigris), involved in a clinical study to evaluate the drug's impact on patients with specific health conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUKE CLINICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Duke Clinical Research Institute performed the analysis for the study involving DrotAA (Xigris, Eli Lilly))\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DROTRAA (XIGRIS, ELI LILLY)<|>ELI LILLY<|>DrotAA (Xigris) is a product of Eli Lilly, indicating a direct product-company relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE CLINICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE<|>ELI LILLY<|>The Duke Clinical Research Institute conducted the analysis for the study sponsored by Eli Lilly, indicating a collaboration between the institute and the company<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
