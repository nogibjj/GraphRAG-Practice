28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates; and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal during the 28 days from randomization in the 2 subsets of patients and in all patients.\n\nAdverse events were carefully monitored and classified as being possibly related to corticosteroids (superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, psychiatric disorders), possibly related to vasopressors (life-threatening arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, limb or cerebral ischemia), related to ICU invasive procedures, and not related to 1 of the 3 previous categories.\n\nSample Size and Statistical Analysis\nA total of 270 patients was the calculated sample size needed to detect, in a 1-sided test performed with a 0.05 type I error, a difference between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate of 20% with a 90% probability, assuming a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup7,22 and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock.7 A 1-sided formulation was chosen to compute the sample size because the trial was designed to test whether low doses of corticosteroids were more effective than placebo, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating the opposite alternative hypothesis (a deleterious effect of corticosteroids).22,23\n\nThe 2 interim analyses were planned using an O'Brien and Fleming stopping boundary.24 With this procedure, the differences between the 2 groups were considered significant if the critical z values were higher than 3.471, 2.454, and 2.004 at the first, second, and final analyses, respectively (corresponding to nominal 2-sided P values <.0005, <.0141 and <.0451, respectively).\n\nThe statistical analysis, prospectively defined, was performed according to the intent-to-treat principle (in all analyses, patients were grouped according to their original randomized treatment) with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For continuous variables, the mean (SDs) are reported whereas, for categorical variables, the number of patients in each category and the corresponding percentages are given.\n\nAnalyses were similarly performed in nonresponders, in responders, and in all patients. Pretreatment characteristics were compared between groups using the t test (for continuous variables) or χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate (for categorical variables). Cumulative event curves (28-day survival and time-to-vasopressor therapy withdrawal end points) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier procedure and median times to event were reported. The effects of treatments on these end points were estimated from adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models25 using baseline cortisol, cortisol response, McCabe classification, LOD score, arterial lactate levels, and PaO2/FIO2 results for the adjustment.8 Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Proportionality among the event rates in the Cox models was assessed by the plot of the log (−log [survival function]) vs time. When the proportionality assumption was not upheld, Cox models were not used and only the Kaplan-Meier curves were reported along with log-rank tests. For 28-day survival, patients who were still alive at 28 days were treated as censored. For this end point, the number needed to treat at 28 days was estimated.26 For time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal, among patients who had more than 1 outcome event during the 28 days from randomization, time to the first event was used in the analyses. For this end point, the patients who died before vasopressor therapy could be withdrawn and those for whom vasopressor therapy could not be withdrawn during the 28 days from randomization were treated as censored. The effects of treatments on the frequency of fatal events (28-day, ICU, hospital and 1-year mortality rates) were estimated from logistic regression analysis using the same variables for the adjustment as the Cox models. Corresponding adjusted odds ratios (ORs) along with their 95% CIs were reported. We also computed the 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year relative risks (RRs) of death along with their 95% CIs. The frequency of adverse events was compared between groups using the χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided.\n\nResults\nStudy Description\nFrom October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999, 1326 patients were screened and 300 patients (placebo, 149; corticosteroids, 151) were included in the study (Figure 1). Interim analyses were performed on April 3, 1997, and April 20, 1998, after the evaluation of 114 and 220 patients, respectively. After each analysis, the independent main end point and safety monitoring board advised the study chairpersons to continue the study. We included the patient in the placebo group who died before study drugs could be administered in our intent-to-treat analysis. One patient in the corticosteroid group was excluded from the final analysis because of consent withdrawal. Among the 299 remaining patients, there were 229 nonresponders (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36).\n\nCharacteristics of Study Patients at Inclusion\nAt baseline, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to general characteristics (Table 1) and severity of illness (Table 2).
