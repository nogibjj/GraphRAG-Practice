For patients with missing data, we used the last-observation-carried-forward method of imputation. The proportion of patients who had serious adverse events and new infections was compared in the two groups with the use of Pearson's chi-square tests. All reported P values are two-sided.\nResults\nAt the time of the second interim analysis of data from 1520 patients, enrollment was suspended because the differences in the mortality rate between the two groups exceeded the a priori guideline for stopping the trial. Results presented here include data from additional patients who were enrolled before the completion of the second interim analysis.\nBase-Line Characteristics of the Patients\nOf 1728 patients who underwent randomization, 1690 received the study drug or placebo. Thirty-eight patients (17 in the placebo group and 21 in the drotrecogin alfa activated group) never received any study drug. In the drotrecogin alfa activated group, 14 patients met at least one exclusion criterion, 4 patients became moribund before the infusion could be started, and consent was withdrawn before the infusion in the case of 3 patients. In the placebo group, 15 patients did not meet the entry criteria for the study, and 2 patients became moribund before the infusion was begun.\nAll randomized patients were followed for the entire 28-day study period except for one patient in the drotrecogin alfa activated group who did not receive the study drug. This patient was classified as having died on day 28 in the mortality analysis of all randomized patients.\nAt base line, the demographic characteristics and severity of disease were similar in the placebo group and the drotrecogin alfa activated group (Table 1). Approximately 75 percent of the patients had at least two dysfunctional organs or systems at the time of enrollment. The lungs and the abdomen were the most common sites of infection, occurring in 53.6 percent and 19.9 percent of the patients, respectively, in the two groups combined (Table 2). The incidence of gram-positive and gram-negative infections was similar within each group and between the two groups. A blinded clinical evaluation committee determined that clinically appropriate antibiotic therapy that was based on the site of infection and available culture and susceptiblitily data was started within 48 hours of the diagnosis of severe sepsis and continued for at least five days or until death in 776 patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group (91.3 percent) and in 766 patients in the placebo group (91.2 percent). Base-line levels of indicators of coagulopathy and inflammation were also similar in the two groups (Table 3). Protein C deficiency was present in 87.6 percent of the patients (1379 of 1574) for whom levels were obtained. In addition, plasma D-dimer and serum interleukin-6 levels were elevated in 99.7 and 98.5 percent of the patients, respectively. Among treated patients, 82.4 percent of those in the placebo group and 81.8 percent of those in the drotrecogin alfa activated group received at least 90 percent of the intended infusion and 8.2 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively, died during the 96-hour period of infusion.\nTable 1\n\nBase-Line Characteristics of the Patients.\nTable 2\n\nSites and Causes of Infection in Patients with Severe Sepsis.\nTable 3\n\nBase-Line Levels of Indicators of Coagulation and Inflammation.\nEfficacy\nTwenty-eight days after the start of the infusion, 259 of 840 patients in the placebo group (30.8 percent) and 210 of 850 (24.7 percent) of the patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group had died. This difference in the rate of death from any cause was significant (P=0.005 in the nonstratified analysis) (Table 4) and was associated with an absolute reduction in the risk of death of 6.1 percent. The prospectively defined primary analysis in which the groups were stratified according to the base-line APACHE II score, age, and protein C activity produced similar results (P=0.005), as did the analysis that included the 38 patients who underwent randomization but who never received the infusion (P=0.003). The results of the prospectively defined primary analysis represent a reduction in the relative risk of death of 19.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.6 to 30.5) in association with treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated, as compared with placebo. A Kaplan–Meier analysis of survival yielded similar results (P=0.006) (Figure 2). The absolute difference in survival between the two groups was evident within days after the initiation of the infusion and continued to increase throughout the remainder of the study period.\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Estimates of Survival among 850 Patients with Severe Sepsis in the Drotrecogin Alfa Activated Group and 840 Patients with Severe Sepsis in the Placebo Group.\nTable 4\n\nAnalysis of the Rates and Risks of Death from Any Cause at 28 Days.\nProspectively defined subgroup analyses were performed for a number of base-line characteristics, including the APACHE II score, the number of dysfunctional organs or systems, other indicators of the severity of disease, sex, age, the site of infection, the type of infection (gram-positive, gram-negative, or mixed), and presence or absence of protein C deficiency.
