A consistent effect of treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was observed among the subgroups (data not shown), including the subgroup with protein C deficiency and the subgroup with normal protein C levels.\nLevels of D-Dimer and Interleukin-6\nPlasma D-dimer levels were significantly lower in patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group than in patients in the placebo group on days 1 through 7 after the start of the infusion (Figure 3). Decreases in serum interleukin-6 levels were significantly greater in the patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group than in the patients in the placebo group on day 1 (P=0.009) and on days 4, 5, 6, and 7 (P=0.025, P=0.017, P=0.016, and P=0.022, respectively).\nFigure 3\n\nChanges in Median Plasma D-Dimer Levels in 770 Patients with Severe Sepsis in the Drotrecogin Alfa Activated Group and 729 Patients in the Placebo Group.\nComplications\nThe percentage of patients who had at least one serious adverse event was similar in the two groups (Table 5). The incidence of serious bleeding was higher in the drotrecogin alfa activated group than in the placebo group (3.5 percent vs. 2.0 percent) (P=0.06). This difference in the incidence of serious bleeding was observed only during the infusion period; thereafter, the incidence was similar in the two groups. Among the patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated, the incidence of serious bleeding was similar for those who received drotrecogin alfa activated alone and those who also received heparin (3.7 percent and 3.5 percent). In both the drotrecogin alfa activated group and the placebo group, serious bleeding occurred primarily in patients with an identifiable predisposition to bleeding, such as gastrointestinal ulceration, an activated partial-thromboplastin time of more than 120 seconds, a prolonged prothrombin time (an international normalized ratio of more than 3.0), a platelet count that decreased to less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter and remained at that level despite standard therapy, traumatic injury of a blood vessel, or traumatic injury of a highly vascular organ. There was a fatal intracranial hemorrhage in two patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group during the infusion (on day 1 and day 4) and in one patient in the placebo group six days after the end of the infusion. After adjustment for the duration of survival, blood-transfusion requirements were similar in the two groups (P=0.90).\nTable 5\n\nIncidence of Serious Adverse Events.\nThere were no other safety concerns associated with treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated on the basis of assessments of organ dysfunction, vital signs, serum chemical data, or hematologic data. The incidence of thrombotic events was similar in the two groups (Table 5). New infections occurred in 25.5 percent of the patients in the drotrecogin alfa activated group and 25.1 percent of the patients in the placebo group (P=0.85). Neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C were not detected in any patient.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, the administration of drotrecogin alfa activated reduced the rate of death from any cause at 28 days in patients with a clinical diagnosis of severe sepsis, resulting in a 19.4 percent reduction in the relative risk of death and an absolute reduction of 6.1 percent. A survival benefit was evident throughout the 28-day study period, whether or not the groups were stratified according to the severity of disease. Our results indicate that in this population, 1 additional life would be saved for every 16 patients treated with drotrecogin alfa activated.\nThough the study population was heterogeneous with respect to clinical features, it was homogeneous with respect to the biochemical evidence of systemic inflammation and coagulopathy. In these patients, the benefit of drotrecogin alfa activated is most likely explained by the drug's biologic activity. Activated protein C inhibits the generation of thrombin by inactivating factor Va and factor VIIIa.30,31 As compared with the patients who received placebo, patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated had greater decreases in plasma D-dimer levels during the first seven days after the infusion was initiated, indicating a reduction in the generation of thrombin. The rise in D-dimer levels after the completion of the 96-hour infusion of drotrecogin alfa activated indicates incomplete resolution of the procoagulant state seen in patients with sepsis. An evaluation of longer periods of infusion of drotrecogin alfa activated may be warranted.\nTreatment with drotrecogin alfa activated decreased inflammation, as indicated by decreases in interleukin-6 levels, a finding consistent with the known antiinflammatory activity of activated protein C. The antiinflammatory activity of drotrecogin alfa activated may be mediated indirectly through the inhibition of the generation of thrombin, which leads to decreased activation of platelets, recruitment of neut\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A drug used in the treatment of severe sepsis, showing a reduction in mortality rates and inflammation markers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A control group in a clinical study comparing the effects of drotrecogin alfa activated on severe sepsis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVERE SEPSIS<|>EVENT<|>A condition characterized by systemic inflammation and coagulopathy, targeted by the study of drotrecogin alfa activated)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTEIN C DEFICIENCY<|>EVENT<|>A condition that was a focus in the subgroup analyses of the study, related to the effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa activated)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>PLACEBO GROUP<|>The study compared the effects of drotrecogin alfa activated against a placebo group in patients with severe sepsis<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>SEVERE SEPSIS<|>Drotrecogin alfa activated was used to treat severe sepsis, showing a reduction in mortality rates<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DROTRECOGIN ALFA ACTIVATED<|>PROTEIN C DEFICIENCY<|>The study analyzed the effect of drotrecogin alfa activated on patients with and without protein C deficiency<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
