It is recognized for its efficacy in reducing mortality in such critically ill patients. As a type of corticosteroid, hydrocortisone plays a crucial role in corticosteroid therapy for septic shock, aiming to improve patient outcomes by mitigating the severe effects of this condition. Additionally, hydrocortisone, in its natural hormone form, is utilized in low doses alongside fludrocortisone to address adrenal insufficiency in critically ill individuals, highlighting its versatility in medical treatment protocols.\n\nIn clinical studies, hydrocortisone is administered as part of a comprehensive treatment regimen. It is provided in vials containing hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder, which is mixed with a glucose solution solvent for administration to patients. This method ensures that the medication is delivered effectively and safely to those in need.\n\nThe medication's role as an adjunctive treatment in septic shock has been thoroughly discussed, with particular attention to its hemodynamic effects. Studies comparing hydrocortisone's efficacy to placebo have shown promising results, indicating its potential to significantly reduce mortality rates among affected patients. One notable clinical trial, supplied by Pfizer, focused on comparing the effects of hydrocortisone with a placebo in patients with septic shock who were also undergoing mechanical ventilation. This trial underscores the ongoing research and interest in hydrocortisone's therapeutic benefits, further establishing its importance in critical care medicine.\",12\n20,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,The Corticosteroid Group refers to a cohort of patients within a clinical study who were administered corticosteroid therapy specifically for the treatment of septic shock. This group demonstrated varying outcomes in terms of mortality rates and the duration until withdrawal from vasopressor therapy when compared to a placebo group. This indicates that the corticosteroid treatment had a distinct impact on the patients' recovery and survival metrics within the context of the study.,7\n1,ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY,\"Adrenal Insufficiency is a medical condition characterized by the adrenal glands' inability to release sufficient amounts of hormones, notably cortisol. This condition is particularly observed in critically ill patients and is presumed to benefit from corticosteroid treatment. It is marked by high-plasma renin activity and low-plasma aldosterone concentrations. Additionally, Adrenal Insufficiency may be linked to septic shock, further highlighting its significance in critical care settings. This condition necessitates careful management to address the hormonal imbalances and mitigate associated risks.\",5\n5,FLUDROCORTISONE,\"Fludrocortisone is a corticosteroid medication that plays a crucial role in the treatment of various conditions, particularly in critically ill patients. It is commonly used in combination with hydrocortisone for the treatment of septic shock, a severe and life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention. This combination therapy is part of a broader corticosteroid treatment strategy aimed at managing septic shock effectively. Additionally, Fludrocortisone, alongside hydrocortisone, is employed to treat adrenal insufficiency. This particular use is justified by the need to address the inability to rule out primary adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients. The dual application of Fludrocortisone in both septic shock and adrenal insufficiency highlights its importance in critical care settings, underscoring its role in managing complex and severe medical conditions.\",4\n40,PFIZER,Pharmaceutical company that supplied hydrocortisone for the clinical trial,2\n43,INTENSIVE CARE UNIT,,2\n23,VASOPRESSOR THERAPY,\"A treatment involving drugs that constrict blood vessels to increase blood pressure, used in this study to manage septic shock\",2\n12,ROUSSEL-UCLAF,\"Roussel-Uclaf is the manufacturer of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder used in the clinical study\"\"\",1\n11,PHARMACIE CENTRALE DES HÔPITAUX,\"Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux provides 9-α-fludrocortisone tablets for the clinical study\"\"\",1\n13,SYNACTHÈNE CIBA,\"Synacthène Ciba is the manufacturer of tetracosactrin used for the short corticotropin test in the clinical study\"\"\",1\n14,IMMUNOTECH,,1\n26,GLUCOCORTICOID,\"Glucocorticoid is a type of corticosteroid that is synthetically produced for high-dose treatments in various conditions, including adrenal insufficiency\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n28,HYDROCORTISONE,PLACEBO GROUP,The efficacy of hydrocortisone was compared to that of the placebo group in a clinical trial involving patients with septic shock,24\n25,HYDROCORTISONE,ADRENAL TRIAL,Hydrocortisone was the medication tested in the ADRENAL trial to assess its efficacy in reducing mortality among septic shock patients,22\n6,SEPTIC SHOCK,HYDROCORTISONE,\"Hydrocortisone has been studied and utilized as part of a treatment regimen for septic shock, with a significant focus on its effects on mortality and hemodynamics in patients.
