It is responsible for the creation of SAS software versions 9.3 and 9.4. These versions are specifically designed to facilitate statistical analysis, with version 9.3 being used in certain studies, while version 9.4 is employed for data analysis in other trials and for conducting all analyses in some studies. As an organization, SAS Institute plays a pivotal role in providing the necessary tools for data analysis through its SAS statistical software, ensuring researchers and analysts have access to state-of-the-art software solutions for their data analysis needs.\",8\n9,APACHE II SCORE,\"The APACHE II score is a severity-of-disease classification system assessed on a scale from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of death. It is used to evaluate the severity of a patient's condition and measure the severity of illness, particularly in patients who are part of a standard-therapy group. This scoring system plays a crucial role in clinical trials and studies, such as those involving drotrecogin alfa activated, by stratifying patients based on their initial condition. It serves as one of the baseline characteristics used to examine the heterogeneity of the treatment effect on mortality. The APACHE II score's ability to quantify the severity of disease makes it an essential tool for healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding patient care and treatment pathways.\",4\n159,STANDARD-THERAPY GROUP,\"The Standard-Therapy Group consists of patients who are receiving protocol-based standard therapy, including the later placement of central venous catheters, compared to those in the Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) group.
