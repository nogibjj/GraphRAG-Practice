Specifically, in the context of septic shock, Fludrocortisone is administered to adults who exhibit persistent vasopressor dependency and organ failures, as part of a corticosteroid therapy aimed at stabilizing the patient's condition. This combination therapy is also justified in critically ill patients due to the potential inability to rule out primary adrenal insufficiency, indicating its critical role in managing conditions associated with adrenal gland dysfunction.
