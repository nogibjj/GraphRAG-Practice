This group was analyzed for comparative purposes against those receiving actual corticosteroid therapy, namely hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. The primary focus of comparison included various health outcomes such as mortality rates, the speed of recovery, and the time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal. Unfortunately, the Placebo Group exhibited higher mortality and slower recovery rates compared to the hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone group.
