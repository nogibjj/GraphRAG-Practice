This group was part of a study aimed at evaluating the effects of corticosteroids on septic shock patients. Compared to the group receiving hydrocortisone or hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone, the Placebo Group exhibited higher mortality rates and slower recovery times. The study also compared various outcomes between the placebo group and those receiving corticosteroids, including mortality rates and the time to withdrawal from vasopressor therapy. The Placebo Group's health outcomes and adherence rates were specifically contrasted against those of the hydrocortisone group, highlighting the differences in treatment efficacy.\",13\n47,HYDROCORTISONE GROUP,\"The Hydrocortisone Group consists of patients who were assigned to receive hydrocortisone as part of a clinical trial. This group was specifically involved in a study focusing on the treatment of septic shock with hydrocortisone. Throughout the trial, these patients showed various health outcomes and demonstrated different rates of adherence to the dosing protocol. The comprehensive data on this group encompasses their assignment to hydrocortisone treatment, their participation in the clinical trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of hydrocortisone in treating septic shock, and the observed results regarding their health outcomes and adherence to the treatment regimen.\",8\n20,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,The Corticosteroid Group refers to a cohort of patients within a clinical study who were administered corticosteroid therapy specifically for the treatment of septic shock. This group demonstrated varying outcomes in terms of mortality rates and the duration until withdrawal from vasopressor therapy when compared to a placebo group. This indicates that the corticosteroid treatment had a distinct impact on the patients' recovery and survival metrics within the context of the study.,7\n48,MECHANICAL VENTILATION,\"Mechanical ventilation is a medical procedure that provides mechanical assistance to facilitate breathing in patients who are unable to breathe adequately on their own. It is a critical treatment method for respiratory failure, including severe cases often associated with septic shock. Mechanical ventilation is notably utilized in clinical settings to support patients with significant respiratory distress, and its effectiveness can be measured in various ways, including the time required to wean patients off the ventilator. This aspect was highlighted in a trial that compared the duration of mechanical ventilation between patients treated with hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone and those receiving a placebo, indicating its importance in the management and recovery of individuals with compromised respiratory function.\",4\n24,ADVERSE EVENTS,\"Adverse events refer to any unintended and harmful events or side effects that occur during the course of a clinical trial, possibly related to the treatment being studied. These events are significant in the context of medical research as they provide crucial information regarding the safety and potential risks associated with a treatment under investigation.\",4\n66,HYDROCORTISONE-PLUS-FLUDROCORTISONE GROUP,\"A group in a clinical trial that received hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone treatment, showing lower mortality and faster recovery in septic shock patients compared to placebo\",4\n23,VASOPRESSOR THERAPY,\"Vasopressor therapy is a medical treatment that involves the administration of drugs designed to constrict blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure. This therapy is primarily used in the management of septic shock and in critically ill patients who require intervention to elevate their blood pressure to safer levels. The effectiveness of vasopressor therapy was evaluated in a study that compared different groups of patients in terms of the time required to wean off these medications. This indicates that vasopressor therapy plays a crucial role in the treatment protocols for patients experiencing severe drops in blood pressure due to conditions like septic shock, with the goal of stabilizing their condition by improving blood flow and oxygen delivery to vital organs.\",3\n50,BLOOD TRANSFUSION,,2\n21,HOSPITAL,The medical facility where patients stayed during treatment and where mortality rates were recorded for the study,2\n46,INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE,A committee that reviewed two prespecified interim analyses of the trial,2\n49,SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS,\"Significant harmful effects experienced by participants in a clinical trial, warranting immediate action\",2\n25,ICU INVASIVE PROCEDURES,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n9,SEPTIC SHOCK,PLACEBO GROUP,Placebo group was part of a clinical trial aiming to treat septic shock,29\n34,HYDROCORTISONE,PLACEBO GROUP,The efficacy of hydrocortisone was compared to that of the placebo group in a clinical trial involving patients with septic shock,26\n8,SEPTIC SHOCK,HYDROCORTISONE GROUP,Hydrocortisone group was part of a clinical trial aiming to treat septic shock,24\n45,ICU,PLACEBO GROUP,\"In a clinical trial, the placebo group, which was compared to the hydrocortisone group, had their time in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) closely monitored.
