This critical condition is characterized by dangerously low blood pressure and multiple organ failure due to sepsis, a dysregulated host response to infection that results in circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities with high short-term mortality rates. Despite adequate fluid resuscitation, patients experience arterial hypotension, indicating persistent vasopressor dependency and organ failures. It occurs in a heterogeneous population, making its management and treatment outcomes a significant focus of clinical trials and studies.\n\nThe condition has been the subject of extensive research, including the evaluation of blood transfusion thresholds and their effects on mortality, use of life support, and other outcomes in ICU patients. Clinical trials have assessed the impact of treatments such as DrotAA, hydrocortisone, and the combination of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone, with studies showing that a 7-day treatment regimen can significantly reduce both short-term and long-term mortality. The administration of hydrocortisone has been particularly noted for its potential effects on patient outcomes, with the ADRENAL trial testing its efficacy against placebo. Other studies have focused on comparing the effects of vasopressin and norepinephrine, mean arterial pressure targets, and the differences in mortality outcomes between albumin and crystalloid treatments.\n\nSeptic shock is also identified as a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation, with research aiming to treat refractory hypotension or high serum lactate levels. Early goal-directed therapy has shown significant benefits, and the condition's management involves comparing treatment effects between dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as assessing the effectiveness of different blood transfusion thresholds. The PROWESS-SHOCK trial targeted the condition for treatment with DrotAA, highlighting the critical nature of timely and effective intervention.\n\nIn summary, septic shock represents a severe condition resulting from an infection causing dangerously low blood pressure and organ failure, with a high mortality rate. It has been the primary focus of numerous clinical trials aiming to improve management and treatment outcomes through various therapeutic approaches, including the use of hydrocortisone, DrotAA, and vasopressors like vasopressin and norepinephrine. The condition's complexity and severity make it a significant challenge in critical care, with ongoing research dedicated to finding more effective treatments and management protocols.\",77\n219,SOFA SCORE,\"The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is a scoring system used to track a patient's status during their stay in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). It focuses on assessing organ failure, with measurements taken at various times to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure. Lower SOFA scores indicate better organ function, and the score is calculated daily for the first 7 days of the ICU stay and then on specified days thereafter. The SOFA score is a critical tool in monitoring the progression of organ failure and helps in comparing the effectiveness of treatments by observing the time it takes for a patient's SOFA score to drop below 6. This comprehensive approach allows healthcare professionals to make informed decisions regarding the care and management of patients in critical condition.\",7\n39,VASOPRESSORS,\"Vasopressors are medications specifically designed to raise blood pressure in critically ill patients by constricting blood vessels. These medications are particularly utilized in the treatment of septic shock and have been a significant part of clinical trial treatment options, including study protocols aimed at evaluating their effectiveness and safety. Within the context of these trials, vasopressors were administered more frequently in the Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) and standard-therapy groups compared to the usual-care group, indicating their pivotal role in managing severe conditions that require the elevation of blood pressure. The study also assessed the relationship of vasopressors to adverse events, highlighting the importance of monitoring and managing potential risks associated with their use in critically ill patients.\",5\n66,INOTROPES,\"Inotropes are a type of medication that plays a crucial role in medical treatment regimens, particularly during clinical trials for some patients. These drugs are specifically designed to affect the force of the heart's contractions, making them an essential component in the treatment of conditions such as septic shock. By influencing how strongly the heart pumps, inotropes help in managing and improving the heart's efficiency, thereby supporting patients with significant heart-related conditions.\",3\n339,ANNANE ET AL.,Researchers who conducted a study on septic shock treatment with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone,1\n149,ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS,\"Medications given at the discretion of the treating physician for sepsis treatment in the study\"\"\",1\n135,BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS,\"The process of transferring blood or blood products into one's circulation intravenously, used in the treatment of septic shock\",1\n385,CANADA,Canada is one of the countries where the multicenter trial on vasopressin versus norepinephrine in septic shock patients was conducted,1\n327,GATTINONI ET AL.,Researchers who conducted a study on hemodynamic optimization in septic shock patients,1\n328,HAYES ET AL.,Researchers who observed a higher in-hospital mortality rate with aggressive hemodynamic optimization in septic shock patients,1\n82,HEMOGLOBIN,\"A key factor in the trial, with different transfusion thresholds set based on hemoglobin levels\",1\n267,ICU (INTENSIVE CARE UNIT),A specialized department in hospitals that provides intensive care medicine and was involved in the study for treating patients with severe sepsis and monitoring the effects of hydrocortisone,1\n141,SCVO2 CATHETERS,\"A medical device that could be used for monitoring in septic shock treatment but was not routinely used in the study\"\"\",1\n264,SEPNET CLINICAL TRIALS GROUP,\"A research consortium focused on studying sepsis and its treatments, which has contributed data on septic shock rates among patients with severe sepsis\",1\n52,WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,\"Identified sepsis as a global health priority, highlighting the need for effective treatments\",1\n380,SUPERINFECTION,\"An infection occurring on top of another infection, often seen in patients with weakened immune systems\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n53,SEPTIC SHOCK,SOFA SCORE,\"The SOFA score, which stands for Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, is a critical tool used to evaluate the severity of organ dysfunction in patients.
