It is characterized by the adrenal glands' inability to release sufficient amounts of hormones, notably cortisol, which plays a crucial role in the body's response to illness and stress. This condition is presumed to benefit from the administration of corticosteroids, as it is marked by high-plasma renin activity and low-plasma aldosterone concentrations, especially in critically ill patients.
