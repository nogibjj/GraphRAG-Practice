It serves as a benchmark against which the effects of corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, are compared. In these studies, PLACEBO is typically administered in the same manner as the active medication, often consisting of 0.9 percent saline with or without 0.1 percent human serum albumin, to ensure that the comparison between the treatment and control groups is fair and unbiased. This approach allows researchers to accurately determine the therapeutic effect of the active drugs being tested. PLACEBO has been utilized in trials comparing its effects against hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock, including those undergoing mechanical ventilation, and in studies assessing the effectiveness of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone. Additionally, it has been used as a control treatment in studies evaluating the efficacy of acetaminophen and in comparison with the DrotAA treatment group. By serving as a control, PLACEBO plays a crucial role in clinical research, helping to validate the results and ensure that any observed effects are truly attributable to the treatment under investigation rather than other variables.\",18\n174,CENTRAL RANDOMIZATION CENTER,\"The facility responsible for the random assignment of patients to either the drotrecogin alfa activated treatment or placebo in a 1:1 manner, ensuring the blinding of treatment assignments\",2\n13,EUROPE,A continent where a significant portion of the study's patients were recruited,2\n14,NORTH AMERICA,A continent where a portion of the study's patients were recruited,2\n15,SOUTH AMERICA,A continent where a portion of the study's patients were recruited,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n16,SEPTIC SHOCK,PLACEBO,\"In the study of treating septic shock, a placebo was utilized as a control to compare its effects against corticosteroids.
