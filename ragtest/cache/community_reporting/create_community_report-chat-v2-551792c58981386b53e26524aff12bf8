It is specifically used for treating patients who exhibit early signs of septic shock in emergency departments. EGDT serves as a resuscitation protocol that has been compared against usual care in a randomized trial, highlighting its effectiveness in clinical settings. Furthermore, it is recognized as a key strategy by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, recommended to decrease mortality rates in patients suffering from septic shock. This comprehensive approach underscores the importance of EGDT in managing septic shock, emphasizing its role in enhancing patient care and survival rates.\",17\n127,USUAL CARE,\"USUAL CARE refers to the control group in a study where patients received standard care without specific protocol interventions. This standard care encompasses the standard resuscitation practice for patients with early septic shock. It is compared against Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) in a randomized trial, serving as the benchmark for standard treatment provided for septic shock without the specific protocols used in EGDT or protocol-based standard therapy.
