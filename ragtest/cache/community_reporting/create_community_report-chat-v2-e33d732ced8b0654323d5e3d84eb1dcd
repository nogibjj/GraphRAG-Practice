It has been assigned to patients in clinical trials to assess its effectiveness in treating sepsis and has been discussed in the context of treating patients with septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, trauma, or CAP, particularly focusing on its effects on delirium and secondary infections. In the treatment of septic shock, hydrocortisone is used alongside fludrocortisone and is part of corticosteroid therapy aimed at patients who do not respond adequately to corticotropin. Its efficacy in treating septic shock without shock remains controversial, although it is associated with a higher risk of hyperglycemia and a lower risk of delirium.\n\nHydrocortisone's role in the management of septic shock is underscored by its hemodynamic effects and potential to speed up the resolution of septic shock, despite conflicting results regarding its impact on mortality. It has been used in a study to treat patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, but it did not decrease mortality despite hastening the reversal of shock. However, it is part of a 7-day treatment regimen for septic shock that showed lower mortality at day 90 and at ICU and hospital discharge than placebo. Additionally, hydrocortisone is studied for its effects on preventing shock in patients with severe sepsis and CAP through early administration to attenuate an exaggerated inflammatory response.\n\nHydrocortisone is also a natural hormone used in low doses in combination with fludrocortisone to treat adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients. It is administered as part of the treatment in clinical studies, provided in vials containing hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder and ampoules with a glucose solution solvent. The medication is discussed as an adjunctive treatment in patients with septic shock, with observations on its hemodynamic effects and comparison to placebo in terms of mortality and secondary outcomes. A clinical trial specifically assessed its efficacy in reducing mortality among patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation, highlighting its critical role in managing complex, life-threatening conditions.\",29\n26,ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY,\"Adrenal Insufficiency is a medical condition that has garnered interest in medical studies, particularly in relation to the body's response to corticotropin and its impact on the treatment of septic shock. It is characterized by the adrenal glands' inability to release sufficient amounts of hormones, notably cortisol, which plays a crucial role in the body's response to illness and stress. This condition is presumed to benefit from the administration of corticosteroids, as it is marked by high-plasma renin activity and low-plasma aldosterone concentrations, especially in critically ill patients. The link between adrenal insufficiency and septic shock is significant, as the condition's impact on hormone release can influence the effectiveness of septic shock treatment.\",6\n76,SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN,\"The Surviving Sepsis Campaign is a global initiative dedicated to reducing mortality from sepsis and septic shock. It endorses guidelines aimed at decreasing mortality among patients, notably through the endorsement of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). The campaign specifically recommends targeting a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg during the initial resuscitation of patients with septic shock and suggests the use of adjunctive hydrocortisone therapy only in cases of refractory septic shock. This comprehensive approach is part of a broader effort to bring together professional organizations worldwide to improve patient outcomes historically.\n\nThe Surviving Sepsis Campaign has developed a set of guidelines that cover both resuscitation and nonresuscitation aspects of care for septic shock. These guidelines advocate for the management of sepsis, including the use of continuous infusion to manage blood glucose control and to reduce hemodynamic and immunological rebound effects. By providing these detailed guidelines, the campaign influences the design and treatment targets of studies and clinical practices focused on septic shock patients, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to treatment across the globe. Through its international efforts, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign aims to make a significant impact on the mortality rates associated with sepsis and septic shock by promoting best practices and fostering collaboration among healthcare professionals.\",6\n30,FLUDROCORTISONE,\"Fludrocortisone is a corticosteroid medication that has been used in combination with hydrocortisone for the treatment of septic shock, particularly in adults with persistent vasopressor dependency and organ failures. This combination therapy is part of a broader corticosteroid treatment strategy aimed at managing septic shock patients, justified by the potential for primary adrenal insufficiency in critically ill individuals. Despite its application in these contexts, Fludrocortisone has been shown to be ineffective in certain trials, indicating that its effectiveness may vary or be context-dependent. Nonetheless, its use alongside hydrocortisone reflects a medical approach to address the complex challenges of treating septic shock and adrenal insufficiency in a critical care setting.\",5\n250,CRITICAL ILLNESS–RELATED CORTICOSTEROID INSUFFICIENCY (CIRCI),\"Critical Illness-Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency (CIRCI) is a concept recommended by an international consensus statement to replace the terms relative or absolute adrenal insufficiency. This condition has been studied extensively in the context of severe sepsis and septic shock. The presence of CIRCI is considered a prognostic factor for the development of septic shock. This redefinition and focus on CIRCI underscore its importance in the critical care setting, highlighting the need for awareness and understanding of this condition among healthcare professionals managing critically ill patients.\",2\n43,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,The Corticosteroid Group refers to a cohort of patients within a clinical study who were administered corticosteroid therapy specifically for the treatment of septic shock. This group demonstrated varying outcomes in terms of mortality rates and the duration until withdrawal from vasopressor therapy when compared to a placebo group. This indicates that the corticosteroid treatment had a distinct impact on the patients' recovery and survival metrics within the context of the study.,7\n262,DELIRIUM,\"Delirium is a condition that was assessed in a study, where it was found to be less frequent in patients treated with hydrocortisone compared to those receiving a placebo. This condition, associated with high serum cortisol concentration and systemic inflammation, developed less frequently in patients who were treated with hydrocortisone, indicating a potential therapeutic effect of hydrocortisone in reducing the incidence of delirium in the context of these specific medical conditions.\",4\n266,CORTICUS TRIAL,\"The CORTICUS TRIAL was a clinical trial that investigated the effects of hydrocortisone on the resolution of septic shock, its association with Critical Illness-Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency (CIRCI), mortality rates, and the impact of etomidate administration. The findings from the trial indicated that there was no significant survival benefit from an 11-day course of hydrocortisone alone in patients with septic shock.

It is part of a treatment regimen that has been shown to significantly reduce mortality in some septic shock patients, although its use has yielded conflicting results regarding mortality outcomes. Despite these discrepancies in mortality benefits, hydrocortisone consistently demonstrates positive hemodynamic effects and contributes to a faster resolution of septic shock symptoms. The substance has been the subject of various studies evaluating its impact on patient outcomes, including mortality, hemodynamic stability, and the incidence of secondary infections. Hydrocortisone's role in the treatment of septic shock, particularly in cases where conventional treatments fail to elicit the desired response, underscores its importance in critical care, even as research continues to explore and define its efficacy and optimal use in this high-risk patient population.\",106\n13,SEPTIC SHOCK,ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY,\"The study focused on the prognostic importance of adrenal insufficiency in patients with septic shock, highlighting its influence on treatment approaches.
