It is commonly used in combination with hydrocortisone for the treatment of septic shock, a severe and life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention. This combination therapy is part of a broader corticosteroid treatment strategy aimed at managing septic shock effectively. Additionally, Fludrocortisone, alongside hydrocortisone, is employed to treat adrenal insufficiency. This particular use is justified by the need to address the inability to rule out primary adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients.
