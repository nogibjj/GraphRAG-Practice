This process includes the calculation of the sample size and employs various statistical tests and principles to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the study results. Among the key techniques used are the intention-to-treat principle, which ensures that all participants are included in the analysis regardless of whether they completed the study as initially allocated, and Fisher's exact test, which is used for the analysis of categorical data. Additionally, the framework incorporates the chi-square test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, both of which are utilized for comparing two groups of data. The Kaplanâ€“Meier method is also employed, which is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data.
