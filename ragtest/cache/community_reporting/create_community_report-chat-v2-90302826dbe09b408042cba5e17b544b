It has been assigned to patients in clinical trials to assess its effectiveness in treating sepsis and has been discussed in the context of treating patients with septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, trauma, or CAP, particularly focusing on its effects on delirium and secondary infections. In the treatment of septic shock, hydrocortisone is used alongside fludrocortisone and is part of corticosteroid therapy aimed at patients who do not respond adequately to corticotropin. Its efficacy in treating septic shock without shock remains controversial, although it is associated with a higher risk of hyperglycemia and a lower risk of delirium.\n\nHydrocortisone's role in the management of septic shock is underscored by its hemodynamic effects and potential to speed up the resolution of septic shock, despite conflicting results regarding its impact on mortality. It has been used in a study to treat patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, but it did not decrease mortality despite hastening the reversal of shock. However, it is part of a 7-day treatment regimen for septic shock that showed lower mortality at day 90 and at ICU and hospital discharge than placebo. Additionally, hydrocortisone is studied for its effects on preventing shock in patients with severe sepsis and CAP through early administration to attenuate an exaggerated inflammatory response.\n\nHydrocortisone is also a natural hormone used in low doses in combination with fludrocortisone to treat adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients. It is administered as part of the treatment in clinical studies, provided in vials containing hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder and ampoules with a glucose solution solvent. The medication is discussed as an adjunctive treatment in patients with septic shock, with observations on its hemodynamic effects and comparison to placebo in terms of mortality and secondary outcomes. A clinical trial specifically assessed its efficacy in reducing mortality among patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation, highlighting its critical role in managing complex, life-threatening conditions.\",29\n76,SURVIVING SEPSIS CAMPAIGN,\"The Surviving Sepsis Campaign is a global initiative dedicated to reducing mortality from sepsis and septic shock. It endorses guidelines aimed at decreasing mortality among patients, notably through the endorsement of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). The campaign specifically recommends targeting a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg during the initial resuscitation of patients with septic shock and suggests the use of adjunctive hydrocortisone therapy only in cases of refractory septic shock. This comprehensive approach is part of a broader effort to bring together professional organizations worldwide to improve patient outcomes historically.\n\nThe Surviving Sepsis Campaign has developed a set of guidelines that cover both resuscitation and nonresuscitation aspects of care for septic shock. These guidelines advocate for the management of sepsis, including the use of continuous infusion to manage blood glucose control and to reduce hemodynamic and immunological rebound effects. By providing these detailed guidelines, the campaign influences the design and treatment targets of studies and clinical practices focused on septic shock patients, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to treatment across the globe. Through its international efforts, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign aims to make a significant impact on the mortality rates associated with sepsis and septic shock by promoting best practices and fostering collaboration among healthcare professionals.\",6\n250,CRITICAL ILLNESS–RELATED CORTICOSTEROID INSUFFICIENCY (CIRCI),\"Critical Illness-Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency (CIRCI) is a concept recommended by an international consensus statement to replace the terms relative or absolute adrenal insufficiency.

This redefinition and focus on CIRCI underscore its importance in the critical care setting, highlighting the need for awareness and understanding of this condition among healthcare professionals managing critically ill patients.\",2\n266,CORTICUS TRIAL,\"The CORTICUS TRIAL was a clinical trial that investigated the effects of hydrocortisone on the resolution of septic shock, its association with Critical Illness-Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency (CIRCI), mortality rates, and the impact of etomidate administration. The findings from the trial indicated that there was no significant survival benefit from an 11-day course of hydrocortisone alone in patients with septic shock.

It is part of a treatment regimen that has been shown to significantly reduce mortality in some septic shock patients, although its use has yielded conflicting results regarding mortality outcomes. Despite these discrepancies in mortality benefits, hydrocortisone consistently demonstrates positive hemodynamic effects and contributes to a faster resolution of septic shock symptoms. The substance has been the subject of various studies evaluating its impact on patient outcomes, including mortality, hemodynamic stability, and the incidence of secondary infections.
