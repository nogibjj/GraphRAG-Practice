It is part of a comprehensive corticosteroid therapy aimed at reducing mortality among patients, especially those undergoing mechanical ventilation. This medication has been tested for its efficacy in clinical studies, where it has been administered in various forms, including vials containing hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder and ampoules with a glucose solution solvent. Hydrocortisone is not only a synthetic form of a natural hormone but also essential in treating adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients, highlighting its versatility and importance in medical treatments.\n\nIn clinical trials, such as one supplied by Pfizer, hydrocortisone has been compared with placebo to observe its hemodynamic effects and overall efficacy in improving patient outcomes. It has been noted for its role as an adjunctive treatment, offering significant benefits when included in a 7-day treatment regimen. This regimen has shown promising results, with lower mortality rates observed at day 90, as well as at ICU and hospital discharge, compared to placebo.
