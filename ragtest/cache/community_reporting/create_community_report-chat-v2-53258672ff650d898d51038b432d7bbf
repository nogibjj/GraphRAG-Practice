It is utilized in clinical studies as part of corticosteroid therapy for septic shock patients, indicating its critical application in managing this severe condition. As a type of corticosteroid, hydrocortisone is specifically used to treat septic shock patients, showcasing its importance in critical care medicine. Additionally, hydrocortisone serves as a natural hormone and is used in low doses in combination with fludrocortisone to treat adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients. This highlights its versatility and essential function in addressing adrenal insufficiency, further underscoring its utility in a clinical setting. The administration of hydrocortisone in clinical studies is facilitated through vials containing hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder, which is mixed with a glucose solution solvent provided in ampoules. This method of administration ensures that hydrocortisone can be effectively delivered to patients as part of their treatment regimen.\",8\n20,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,The Corticosteroid Group refers to a cohort of patients within a clinical study who were administered corticosteroid therapy specifically for the treatment of septic shock. This group demonstrated varying outcomes in terms of mortality rates and the duration until withdrawal from vasopressor therapy when compared to a placebo group. This indicates that the corticosteroid treatment had a distinct impact on the patients' recovery and survival metrics within the context of the study.,7\n1,ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY,\"Adrenal Insufficiency is a medical condition characterized by the adrenal glands' inability to release sufficient amounts of hormones, notably cortisol. This condition is particularly observed in critically ill patients and is presumed to benefit from corticosteroid treatment. It is marked by high-plasma renin activity and low-plasma aldosterone concentrations. Additionally, Adrenal Insufficiency may be linked to septic shock, further highlighting its significance in critical care settings. This condition necessitates careful management to address the hormonal imbalances and mitigate associated risks.\",5\n5,FLUDROCORTISONE,\"Fludrocortisone is a corticosteroid medication that plays a crucial role in the treatment of various conditions, particularly in critically ill patients. It is commonly used in combination with hydrocortisone for the treatment of septic shock, a severe and life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention. This combination therapy is part of a broader corticosteroid treatment strategy aimed at managing septic shock effectively. Additionally, Fludrocortisone, alongside hydrocortisone, is employed to treat adrenal insufficiency. This particular use is justified by the need to address the inability to rule out primary adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients. The dual application of Fludrocortisone in both septic shock and adrenal insufficiency highlights its importance in critical care settings, underscoring its role in managing complex and severe medical conditions.\",4\n24,ADVERSE EVENTS,\"Refers to any harmful events or side effects that occurred during the study, possibly related to the treatment\",3\n12,ROUSSEL-UCLAF,\"Roussel-Uclaf is the manufacturer of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder used in the clinical study\"\"\",1\n11,PHARMACIE CENTRALE DES HÔPITAUX,\"Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux provides 9-α-fludrocortisone tablets for the clinical study\"\"\",1\n13,SYNACTHÈNE CIBA,\"Synacthène Ciba is the manufacturer of tetracosactrin used for the short corticotropin test in the clinical study\"\"\",1\n14,IMMUNOTECH,,1\n26,GLUCOCORTICOID,\"Glucocorticoid is a type of corticosteroid that is synthetically produced for high-dose treatments in various conditions, including adrenal insufficiency\",2\n25,ICU INVASIVE PROCEDURES,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n6,SEPTIC SHOCK,HYDROCORTISONE,Hydrocortisone is part of a treatment that significantly reduces mortality in septic shock patients,16\n22,HYDROCORTISONE,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,Hydrocortisone was used as part of the corticosteroid therapy administered to the corticosteroid group,15\n8,ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY,HYDROCORTISONE,Hydrocortisone is used to treat adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients,13\n0,SEPTIC SHOCK,ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY,\"Septic shock may be associated with adrenal insufficiency, prompting the study on corticosteroid treatment\",13\n29,PLACEBO GROUP,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,The placebo group and corticosteroid group were compared in a clinical study to assess the effects of corticosteroids on mortality rates and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal,12\n7,SEPTIC SHOCK,FLUDROCORTISONE,\"Fludrocortisone, combined with hydrocortisone, is used in treating septic shock patients to reduce mortality\",12\n17,HYDROCORTISONE,FLUDROCORTISONE,Both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were used in the study to treat septic shock,12\n23,FLUDROCORTISONE,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,Fludrocortisone was used alongside hydrocortisone in the corticosteroid therapy for the corticosteroid group,11\n10,ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY,CORTICOSTEROIDS,\"Corticosteroids are used to treat adrenal insufficiency, particularly in critically ill patients\",10\n35,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,ADVERSE EVENTS,The study monitored adverse events in relation to the corticosteroid therapy administered to the corticosteroid group,10\n28,ICU,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,The corticosteroid group's mortality rates were monitored in the ICU,10\n9,ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY,FLUDROCORTISONE,Fludrocortisone is added to hydrocortisone treatment for adrenal insufficiency due to its role in addressing primary adrenal insufficiency,9\n33,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,HOSPITAL,The corticosteroid group's mortality rates and health outcomes were recorded during their hospital stay,9\n34,CORTICOSTEROID GROUP,VASOPRESSOR THERAPY,The corticosteroid group was analyzed for the effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy in reducing the duration of vasopressor therapy,9\n18,HYDROCORTISONE,ROUSSEL-UCLAF,Hydrocortisone used in the study is produced by Roussel-Uclaf,9\n19,HYDROCORTISONE,PHARMACIE CENTRALE DES HÔPITAUX,\"Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux provides 9-α-fludrocortisone, which is used alongside hydrocortisone in the study\",9\n20,HYDROCORTISONE,SYNACTHÈNE CIBA,\"Synacthène Ciba produces tetracosactrin, used to test cortisol response in patients treated with hydrocortisone\",9\n21,HYDROCORTISONE,IMMUNOTECH,Immunotech's radioimmunoassay is used for measuring cortisol levels in patients treated with hydrocortisone,9\n32,PLACEBO GROUP,ADVERSE EVENTS,The study also monitored adverse events in the placebo group to compare with those possibly related to corticosteroid therapy,8\n11,ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY,GLUCOCORTICOID,High doses of synthetic glucocorticoid compounds are contrasted with the low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone used for adrenal insufficiency,7\n14,CORTICOSTEROIDS,GLUCOCORTICOID,Glucocorticoid is a specific type of corticosteroid used in certain treatments,7\n36,ADVERSE EVENTS,ICU INVASIVE PROCEDURES,The study compared rates of adverse events related to ICU invasive procedures between the corticosteroid and placebo groups,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
