It is often used alongside fludrocortisone, especially in cases of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients. The medication has been a subject of various clinical studies aimed at evaluating its efficacy in reducing mortality among septic shock patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Despite its widespread use and the hastening of shock reversal, some studies have noted that hydrocortisone did not significantly decrease mortality rates. \n\nHydrocortisone is administered in a specific form, with vials containing hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder and ampoules with a glucose solution solvent, indicating a standardized approach to its delivery in clinical settings. It has been part of a 7-day treatment regimen that showed lower mortality at day 90 and at ICU and hospital discharge compared to placebo, highlighting its potential benefits in certain patient populations. The medication's hemodynamic effects have been observed as beneficial, serving as an adjunctive treatment in septic shock management. \n\nNotably, hydrocortisone has been supplied by Pfizer for clinical trials, which compared its effects with those of a placebo in patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation.
