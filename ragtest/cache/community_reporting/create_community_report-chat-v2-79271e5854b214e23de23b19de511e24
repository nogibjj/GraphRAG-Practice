It was also the treatment administered to patients in both groups during a clinical trial, highlighting its significance and widespread application in medical practice. Intravenous fluids play a crucial role in maintaining or restoring a patient's fluid balance, delivering medications, and providing nutritional support, making them an essential component of patient care in various medical settings.\",4\n153,USUAL-CARE GROUP,\"The USUAL-CARE GROUP in the clinical trial consists of patients who received standard care without the early interventions that were applied to the EGDT (Early Goal-Directed Therapy) group. This group of patients was treated during the trial with standard treatment protocols, which did not include the specific protocols used in other groups within the same trial. Their care was characterized by receiving the least volume of intravenous fluids and having central venous catheters placed later compared to other groups. In this group, bedside providers directed all care without the prompting of actions by study coordinators, emphasizing the group's adherence to usual care practices.
