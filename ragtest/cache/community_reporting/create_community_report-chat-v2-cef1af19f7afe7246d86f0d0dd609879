It is specifically used for treating patients who exhibit early signs of septic shock in emergency departments. EGDT serves as a resuscitation protocol that has been compared against usual care in a randomized trial, highlighting its effectiveness in clinical settings. Furthermore, it is recognized as a key strategy by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, recommended to decrease mortality rates in patients suffering from septic shock. This comprehensive approach underscores the importance of EGDT in managing septic shock, emphasizing its role in enhancing patient care and survival rates.\",17\n161,PROCESS TRIAL,\"The PROCESS trial was a clinical study aimed at comparing the effectiveness of different protocol-based care approaches, including a resuscitation algorithm similar to Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT), against usual care in reducing mortality among patients with septic shock.

The findings from the PROCESS trial indicated that there were similar outcomes in hospital mortality and treatment methods used when comparing the effectiveness of EGDT protocols against usual care.
