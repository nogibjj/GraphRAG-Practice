{"result": "Standard Therapy refers to the conventional treatment protocol used for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock before the introduction of early goal-directed therapy. This approach involves clinicians' discretion for hemodynamic support without adhering to the specific early goal-directed therapy protocol. It served as the control treatment in studies comparing its effectiveness against early goal-directed therapy. Despite meeting certain treatment goals, Standard Therapy often resulted in a significant percentage of patients remaining in an oxygen-dependent phase after six hours. Furthermore, when compared to early goal-directed therapy, Standard Therapy exhibited higher mortality rates among patients. This underscores its role as the conventional treatment approach against which newer, potentially more effective therapies are measured.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
