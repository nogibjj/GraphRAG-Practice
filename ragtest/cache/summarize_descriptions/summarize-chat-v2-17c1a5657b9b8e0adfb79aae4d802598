{"result": "The Surviving Sepsis Campaign is a global initiative dedicated to reducing mortality from sepsis and septic shock. It endorses guidelines aimed at decreasing mortality among patients, notably through the endorsement of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). The campaign specifically recommends targeting a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg during the initial resuscitation of patients with septic shock and suggests the use of adjunctive hydrocortisone therapy only in cases of refractory septic shock. This comprehensive approach is part of a broader effort to bring together professional organizations worldwide to improve patient outcomes historically.\n\nThe Surviving Sepsis Campaign has developed a set of guidelines that cover both resuscitation and nonresuscitation aspects of care for septic shock. These guidelines advocate for the management of sepsis, including the use of continuous infusion to manage blood glucose control and to reduce hemodynamic and immunological rebound effects. By providing these detailed guidelines, the campaign influences the design and treatment targets of studies and clinical practices focused on septic shock patients, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to treatment across the globe. Through its international efforts, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign aims to make a significant impact on the mortality rates associated with sepsis and septic shock by promoting best practices and fostering collaboration among healthcare professionals.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
