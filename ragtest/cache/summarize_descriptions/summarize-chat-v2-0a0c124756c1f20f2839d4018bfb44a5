{"result": "VT, or tidal volume, is an independent variable in mechanical ventilation trials for patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), highlighting its significance in the study of lung protection strategies. It is associated with survival outcomes, underscoring its critical role in the clinical trials focused on ARDS.
