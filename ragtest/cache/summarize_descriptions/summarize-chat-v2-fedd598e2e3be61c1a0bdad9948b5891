{"result": "Delirium is a condition that was assessed in a study, where it was found to be less frequent in patients treated with hydrocortisone compared to those receiving a placebo. This condition, associated with high serum cortisol concentration and systemic inflammation, developed less frequently in patients who were treated with hydrocortisone, indicating a potential therapeutic effect of hydrocortisone in reducing the incidence of delirium in the context of these specific medical conditions.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
