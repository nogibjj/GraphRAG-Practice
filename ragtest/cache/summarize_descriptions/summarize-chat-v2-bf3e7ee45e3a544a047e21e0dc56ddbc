{"result": "Scrooge's nephew, directly related to Scrooge, stands in stark contrast to his uncle through his positive outlook on Christmas. He is persistent in inviting Scrooge to celebrate the holiday, demonstrating a deep familial relationship and concern for Scrooge's well-being. Despite Scrooge's dismissive and cynical attitude, his nephew remains the only family member who attempts to maintain a relationship with him. He tirelessly tries to share the Christmas spirit with Scrooge, who remains resolutely dismissive and cold towards the festivities and the warmth it brings.
