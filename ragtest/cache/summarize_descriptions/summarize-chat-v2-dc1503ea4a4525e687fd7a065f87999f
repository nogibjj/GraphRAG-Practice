{"result": "Drotrecogin alfa (activated) was a medication with antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, and profibrinolytic properties, initially used in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. It is a recombinant human activated protein C. Despite its early use, Drotrecogin alfa (activated) was withdrawn from the market in 2011 due to subsequent trials that did not confirm its survival benefit for patients. This decision followed its examination in various studies, including the APROCCHSS trial, which tested its effectiveness in patients with septic shock, particularly in combination with corticosteroids. However, its relevance and use in clinical practice diminished following its market withdrawal, marking the end of its consideration as a therapeutic option for septic shock.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
