"Among patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency, do corticosteroids reduce 28-day mortality?","### Overview Septic shock, a severe and life-threatening condition characterized by circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities due to an infection, often leads to high mortality rates among critically ill patients. The management of septic shock, especially in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency, has been a subject of extensive research, with corticosteroids being a focal point of investigation. Relative adrenal insufficiency, a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient amounts of cortisol in response to stress, is common in septic shock patients and can significantly influence treatment outcomes. ### Corticosteroids in Septic Shock Treatment Corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, have been studied for their potential to improve survival in septic shock patients with relative adrenal insufficiency. These medications are thought to modulate the immune response and reduce inflammation, potentially improving blood pressure and reducing the need for vasopressor agents, which are used to treat life-threatening hypotension. ### Clinical Trial Evidence A pivotal clinical trial conducted in France from October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999, assessed the impact of low doses of corticosteroids on 28-day survival in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency [Data: Sources (0)]. This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial involved 300 adult patients who fulfilled the usual criteria for septic shock and underwent a short corticotropin test to determine adrenal responsiveness. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone or matching placebos for 7 days. The primary outcome measure was the 28-day survival distribution in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency (nonresponders to the corticotropin test). ### Findings and Implications The trial found that in nonresponders to the corticotropin test, there were significantly fewer deaths in the corticosteroid group compared to the placebo group (53% vs. 63%, respectively), with a hazard ratio of 0.67, indicating a 33% reduction in the risk of death [Data: Sources (0)]. Additionally, vasopressor therapy was withdrawn within 28 days in a higher percentage of patients in the corticosteroid group compared to the placebo group, suggesting an improvement in hemodynamic stability. These results suggest that a 7-day treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduces the risk of death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency without increasing adverse events. This finding supports the use of corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy in this specific patient population, potentially offering a significant benefit in terms of survival. ### Conclusion In conclusion, among patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency, corticosteroids do reduce 28-day mortality. This evidence supports the integration of corticosteroid therapy into the treatment regimen for septic shock patients with demonstrated relative adrenal insufficiency, highlighting the importance of personalized treatment approaches based on adrenal responsiveness. Further research may be required to optimize dosing and treatment duration, as well as to explore the effects of corticosteroids in broader septic shock populations. "
